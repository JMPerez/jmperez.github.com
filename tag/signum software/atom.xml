    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I change jobs, from <a href="http://signumsoftware.com/en">Signum Software</a> to <a href="http://www.tuenti.com/">Tuenti</a>.</p>
<p>Working at Signum Software I have met a group of very professional people and I learnt a lot from them. It is a pleasure to work at a company that takes care of their own products, always trying to improve them. And for a developer it’s even better when that product is a complete framework that optimizes and makes your work easier.</p>

<p>If you are willing to carry out a .Net project, you’d better have a look at Signum Framework. Version 2 will be soon released, and lots of new features will be presented. You can follow them on <a href="http://twitter.com/signumframework">twitter @signumframework</a> to get last news, and extended documentation is available on <a href="http://www.signumframework.com/">signumframework.com</a>.</p>
<p>I wish Signum the best of luck, and I hope more developers realize how Signum Framework can improve their projects development, manageability and maintainability.</p>
