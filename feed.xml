    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Web Performance is important for user experience and business metrics. Estimating its impact is key to be able to prioritize it, yet it’s difficult to quantify its benefits until the work has been done.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:39.6285%;margin-bottom:1rem">  <img src="/assets/images/posts/assess-performance-impact/performance-is-money.svg" alt="" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0"></div><p>We need to break this chicken-and-egg loop. This post explains several ways of assessing the potential performance gains with little effort and, more importantly, without actually implementing fixes.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="What-is-the-business-opportunity-for-web-performance-improvements"><a href="#What-is-the-business-opportunity-for-web-performance-improvements" class="headerlink" title="What is the business opportunity for web performance improvements?"></a>What is the business opportunity for web performance improvements?</h2><p>In the past I have been too naive thinking that every stakeholder would care as much as I do about web performance. <em>“Look, there are many case studies proving a correlation between loading time and business metrics!”</em> - I would repeat over and over. Previous results from other companies or websites, like <a href="https://wpostats.com/">those published on WPO Stats</a>, are essential to start a conversation about the topic, but it’s not sufficient. <strong>How will that apply to my business?</strong></p><p>I thought that the best way to prove the value would be to <a href="https://web.dev/measure">audit performance using Lighthouse</a>, fix the issue with lowest effort/highest impact, and measure. This can work if the audit shows potential improvements and the stakeholders agree to dedicate time and people to run the initial experiment.</p><p>However, more often than not <strong>performance audits are not enough to move the needle</strong>. Yes, you can get an estimation of potential time savings, but can’t be translated directly into conversions or revenue, which are the metrics that the business cares about.</p><p>During last months I have come across these low effort techniques to size the opportunity for web performance improvements linking performance metrics to business metrics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Plotting Business Metrics vs Performance Metrics</strong>: How to track both performance metrics and business metrics and establish correlations between them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Measuring the Relative Mobile Conversion Rate</strong>: Identify performance issues by comparing the conversion rates on mobile and desktop.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using Test My Site from Think with Google</strong>: Gives you an estimation of potential revenue increase for your site when saving loading time.</p></li></ol><h2 id="1-Plotting-Business-Metrics-vs-Performance-Metrics"><a href="#1-Plotting-Business-Metrics-vs-Performance-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="1. Plotting Business Metrics vs Performance Metrics"></a>1. Plotting Business Metrics vs Performance Metrics</h2><p>Think about what you are trying to drive on your existing site. Is it newsletter registrations? Leads? Purchases? When a user performs those actions, the user has converted. It’s important to track these conversion events, and you can do it in your own system or leveraging tools like Google Analytics or Facebook Analytics.</p><p>Now the question is: <strong>how does user experience affect conversion rate?</strong> Assuming there are enough conversions, it is possible to cluster these conversions based on a performance metric. This is exactly what <a href="https://twitter.com/cpclermont">CP Clermont</a> did at ALDO and <a href="https://simplified.dev/performance/impact-of-web-performance">described in his post “The Impact of Web Performance”</a>.</p><p>The idea is that <strong>if we can prove that users having a better web performance are converting more often, we can measure the impact of improving user’s experience in money terms</strong>. The best thing is that the effort is relatively low:</p><ol><li>Track the conversion event, which you might be doing already</li><li>Add an event with a performance metric category. CP Clermont chose First Paint, Time to Interactive, Time to App Load (a custom metric for ALDO’s SPA), and Frames per Second. Then, he translated the metrics into 3 categories (good, average, and poor) and logged a custom dimension on Google Analytics.</li><li>Plot business metrics vs performance metrics over time. For business metrics CP Clermont chose Conversion Rate and Revenue.</li></ol><figure><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:52.26244%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-first-paint-cr_obhsnn.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-first-paint-cr_obhsnn.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-first-paint-cr_obhsnn.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-first-paint-cr_obhsnn.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-first-paint-cr_obhsnn.png"    alt="Plotting Conversion Rate for each First Paint Category (good, average, slow)" /></div><figcaption>Plotting Conversion Rate for each First Paint Category (good, average, slow) ([source](https://simplified.dev/performance/impact-of-web-performance))</figcaption></figure>One could wonder if users having a better performance and spending more because they are using better devices (ie the latest iPhone), which have better CPUs and their users have likely a higher purchase power.<figure><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:40.8649%"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-iphone8-dollar-per-session_zdvrlm.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-iphone8-dollar-per-session_zdvrlm.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-iphone8-dollar-per-session_zdvrlm.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-iphone8-dollar-per-session_zdvrlm.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_simplified-iphone8-dollar-per-session_zdvrlm.png"    alt="Plotting Revenue per session for a specific device (iPhone 8) depending on FPS after click" /></div><figcaption>Plotting Revenue per session for a specific device (iPhone 8) depending on FPS after click ([source](https://simplified.dev/performance/impact-of-web-performance))</figcaption></figure><p>Using Google Analytics you can see what type of device the user is using and plot results by specific models to get an answer.</p><h2 id="2-Measuring-the-Relative-Mobile-Conversion-Rate"><a href="#2-Measuring-the-Relative-Mobile-Conversion-Rate" class="headerlink" title="2.Measuring the Relative Mobile Conversion Rate"></a>2.Measuring the Relative Mobile Conversion Rate</h2><p>Another easy way to spot performance issues and making a business case is to look at conversation rates. This is <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/mobile-challenge-and-how-measure-it/">what Google calls Relative Mobile Conversion Rate (Rel mCvR)</a>, which is calculated by dividing the mobile conversion rate with the desktop conversion rate.</p><p>Take this example:</p><table style="margin:0 auto 1rem">    <tr>        <td></td>        <th scope="col" style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:0.5em 1em">Mobile</th>        <th scope="col" style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:0.5em 1em">Desktop</th>    </tr>    <tr>        <th style="font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:0.5em 1em" scope="row">Conversion rate</th>        <td style="text-align:right;padding:0.5em 1em">1.79%</td>        <td style="text-align:right;padding:0.5em 1em">4.44%</td>    </tr>    <tr>        <th style="font-weight:bold;text-align:left;padding:0.5em 1em" scope="row">Rel mCvR</th>        <td style="font-weight:bold;text-align:right;padding:0.5em 1em" colspan="2">1.79% / 4.44% = 40%</td>    </tr></table><p>In this case the Rel mCvR is 40%.</p><p>Google says that <strong>a good target for Rel mCvR is 70%</strong>, meaning that mobile conversion rates are 30% lower than desktop. The reason why Rel mCvR can be a good metric is that it is not influenced by changes in traffic (eg seasonality or promotional campaigns). The following diagram explains it in more detail:</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:50.1462%"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_rel-mcvr_jgbeqo.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_rel-mcvr_jgbeqo.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_rel-mcvr_jgbeqo.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_rel-mcvr_jgbeqo.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_rel-mcvr_jgbeqo.png"    alt="Explanation of Relative mobile conversion rate and its components" /></div><figcaption>Explanation of Relative mobile conversion rate and its components ([source](https://www.blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/mobile-challenge-and-how-measure-it/))</figcaption></figure><p>Note that Rel mCvR is influenced by UX too, since a bad UX on mobile will hurt mobile conversion rates. <strong>You should use <a href="https://web.dev/measure">Lighthouse</a> or <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> to ensure that there are performance issues and speed is the main contributor in Rel mCvR, and not usability.</strong></p><p>The key question is: <em>what’s the target Rel mCvR?</em> If we knew it we could assess the revenue that an increase in conversion rates would represent. For this we can use a similar approach to the first technique we described, clustering conversion rates based on performance metrics and calculating how many user could be “upgraded” to the following cluster (eg from slow to average experience and from average to fast).</p><p><strong>Rel mCvR can also be used to calculate the incremental revenue achieved after making a performance fix</strong>. Measure what was the average Rel mCvR before and after the fix, and calculate what the revenue would have been if Rel mCvR hadn’t changed.On <a href="https://web.dev/value-of-speed/">their post “Value of Speed”</a> you can find more information about the methodology and framework to measure the revenue impact.</p><h2 id="3-Using-Test-My-Site-from-Think-with-Google"><a href="#3-Using-Test-My-Site-from-Think-with-Google" class="headerlink" title="3.

I would describe as a “Lighthouse report for business people”.</p><figure><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:63.743%"><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/testmysite/"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site_yxsqan.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site_yxsqan.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site_yxsqan.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site_yxsqan.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site_yxsqan.png"    alt="Screenshot of Google's Test My Site page" /></a></div><figcaption>Screenshot of [Google's Test My Site page](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/testmysite/)</figcaption></figure><p>To calculate the potential increase in revenue you only need to provide your average monthly visitors, conversion rate, and average order value.</p><figure><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:48.83%"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site-potential-revenue_meu5vx.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site-potential-revenue_meu5vx.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site-potential-revenue_meu5vx.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site-potential-revenue_meu5vx.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1584185288/assess-performance-impact/assess-performance-impact_test-my-site-potential-revenue_meu5vx.png"    alt="Calculating potential increase in annual revenue using Google's Test My Site" /></a></div><figcaption>Calculating potential increase in annual revenue using [Google's Test My Site page](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/testmysite/)</figcaption></figure><p>Behind the scenes it is powered by data from the Chrome User Experience report database or HTTP Archive, which contains performance metrics gathered from real users that have visited your site (if you are interested in this data I recommend checking <a href="https://crux.run/">CRUX.RUN</a>).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before joining Facebook as a Solutions Engineer I had many questions about what the role implied and if it was a good fit for me. After almost one year into the role I wanted to share more about what we do and inspire you.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1574089969/solutions-engineer-facebook_bke37d.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1574089969/solutions-engineer-facebook_bke37d.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1574089969/solutions-engineer-facebook_bke37d.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1574089969/solutions-engineer-facebook_bke37d.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1574089969/solutions-engineer-facebook_bke37d.jpg"    alt="Solutions Engineer sign at Facebook" /></div><p>I had been working as a software engineer for 10+ years, mainly building web applications. I was starting to feel that I didn’t enjoy dedicating 100% of my time to code, and wanted to understand why I was building what I was building.</p><span id="more"></span><p>What kind of metrics was I trying to move? How did I validate that the project was successful? How did I iterate on it once the initial version was shipped? And, especially, how could I propose and drive projects that I thought could be valuable to the company?</p><p>I wanted to apply technology to solve business problems, and move away from seeing technology as a goal itself.</p><p>I had never heard of the “Solutions Engineer” role, but when people at Facebook described it to me it was clear what gaps it was trying to solve.</p><div style="text-align:center; border: 1px solid #aaa; padding: 1em; margin: 1em">👉 We have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/jobs/?sub_teams[0]=Solutions%20Engineering">open positions, both full-time and internships</a>, for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/solutions-engineering-at-facebook/">Solutions Engineers</a>. Do you want to know more? <a href="/about-me/#Contact">Reach out to me</a>.</div><h2 id="What-is-a-Solutions-Engineer-at-Facebook"><a href="#What-is-a-Solutions-Engineer-at-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="What is a Solutions Engineer at Facebook"></a>What is a Solutions Engineer at Facebook</h2><p>Having worked previously building public APIs I felt that disconnection between consumers (partners, small and large developers) and internal teams. Advocating for a technology can get you somewhere, but if you are not able to address consumer’s feedback, identify opportunities and test them, then you won’t get far.</p><p>Solutions Engineer partner with companies that advertise on Facebook (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Whatsapp) and help them make sound decisions on their technical integration. This goes all the way from how they setup basic events on their website to know what actions users are performing during a purchase flow, to fully automate campaigns with dynamic creatives, audiences and bidding.</p><p>Best of all is that <strong>Solutions Engineers are Software Engineers</strong>. This might seem obvious from the role title, but it holds true on a daily basis. We identify business opportunities that can’t be addressed with our current tools, create proposals, validate them by building them ourselves, and scale. We are the ones closest to the advertiser and the best to help product teams making their projects succeed with real customers.</p><p>We spend roughly half of our time building features and products in collaboration with other teams from Facebook, solving problems we have identified after working with advertisers.</p><h2 id="How-is-it-in-practice"><a href="#How-is-it-in-practice" class="headerlink" title="How is it in practice?"></a>How is it in practice?</h2><p>Most of my colleagues have created their own companies or have worked as CTOs. And in practice, one would say we act sometimes as mini-CTOs inside the teams working with advertisers. <strong>We care about the advertiser’s challenges</strong> (eg increase brand awareness, sell more products, increase gross margin, reduce churn of users) and help out using our tools.</p><p>We are not told what to do and it is expected that we pull help from product teams, design, or marketing to propose and drive projects. And ultimately, prove that it drove some measurable impact to both the advertiser and Facebook. All this while getting access to the data and tools you need to do your job keeping process at a minimum. I must say I’m greatly surprised how smooth this works at Facebook, taking into account its humongous size.</p><p><strong>This level of freedom and trust can be challenging at first</strong>. If you are used to being told what to do, then this is not an environment you will thrive at first. This can be challenging but in the long term is highly rewarding. There is the expectation that you come up with ideas, so rather than people telling you to keep yourself within your role’s boundaries, you will see colleagues supporting you all the way.</p><p>The role is very flexible and every Solutions Engineer works differently. Some are working with advertisers within a certain vertical (ecomm, retail, travel, fintech, games…), others within a certain region. For instance, I support advertisers in the Nordics across all verticals.</p><p>Each company has their own unique challenges, and the goal is to identify how our solutions are falling short and how we can improve it, without shortcuts. Every new project adds complexity: more code to maintain, more products to support users with, a bigger surface prone to bugs. That’s why we align with other Solutions Engineers working to identify similar problems with the advertisers they work with, and help build a case for a project that doesn’t solve a specific limitation for a company, but can scale. Ultimately <strong>the tools that a large company can use to do marketing on Facebook are the same ones you and I can use</strong>.</p><h2 id="Want-to-apply-or-know-more"><a href="#Want-to-apply-or-know-more" class="headerlink" title="Want to apply or know more?"></a>Want to apply or know more?</h2><p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out on Twitter or email. <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/life/solutions-engineering-at-facebook/">We have open positions for the role</a></strong>.

I traveled there sometimes and I mainly cover the ecomm and retail verticals there, and I’ve been with Facebook for two and a half years.</p><p><strong>Yannick Mahé</strong>: My name is Yannick. I am a Solutions Engineering Manager. I’m based in Paris. I work for the whole of southern Europe so at Facebook that means France, Italy, Spain and Israel. I work on the automotive verticals and have members of my team work on other verticals like luxury, retail, travel, and e-commerce.</p><p><strong>Yash Sahay</strong>: Hi, I’m Yash. I’m a partner engineer manager on the platform partnerships team. I lead the partner engineering team for EMEA and we focus on platform products like Messenger, AR Camera, Portal yeah camera portal and Facebook products for Europe and East Africa.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Nice! And I guess to close out, my name’s Jordan I too work here in London and have been on the team for about five years and I currently focus on our small to medium businesses so I really think about how we can help grow the smallest advertises on our platform.</p><h4 id="What-partner-engineers-and-solutions-engineers-at-Facebook-do"><a href="#What-partner-engineers-and-solutions-engineers-at-Facebook-do" class="headerlink" title="What partner engineers and solutions engineers at Facebook do?"></a>What partner engineers and solutions engineers at Facebook do?</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: So let’s jump in and look at some of the questions that have been submitted before the event took off. First, both partners and solutions engineering appear to be very unique roles in the industry. <strong>Can you describe what partner engineers and solutions engineers at Facebook do?</strong></p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: Partner engineering is a pretty unique role in the industry. I think everybody has their interpretation of what that is at different companies. At Facebook the role requires you to either focus on specific business verticals, and therefore work with partners in those business verticals, and bring them on board to our family of Facebook products that are designed or catering to those verticals. Or partner engineers could be working on different developer products which are spanning across a set of business verticals and roles.</p><h4 id="The-role-of-Solutions-Engineer-at-Facebook"><a href="#The-role-of-Solutions-Engineer-at-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="The role of Solutions Engineer at Facebook"></a>The role of Solutions Engineer at Facebook</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Flora, <strong>how would you describe Solutions Engineering at Facebook?</strong></p><p><strong>Flora</strong> That’s kind of a hard question. Obviously I’ve explained it so many times to some of my friends. It’s a very unique mixture of client facing and engineering. We spent about half of our time actually coding on the Facebook stack and the other half working directly with the advertisers. That means that we are not only trying to help our most important advertisers by partnering with them, but we’re also trying to learn from them to see what would be most impactful to work on. We write a lot of prototypes, for example, for these kind of ideas that we got from working with these clients.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: And to slightly change the question to you, Yannick, what is it that attracted you to the role in solutions engineering.</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: I have a background of being a very tech oriented guy at different companies and start ups and being at a more pure technical level, even if in management. This is one role where you get the opportunity to be really connected to the business. You talk with sales people, sales leaders, clients… You talk with the client’s CEO to explain to them how Facebook technology can help them unlock new potential and that’s a very unique proposition for this role.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Nice! And Yash, anything you want to add about why you wanted to join Facebook?</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: I’ve been a career entrepreneur my entire life before Facebook and this is one of those roles which allows me to still be an entrepreneur, but inside of Facebook. I get to work with cross-functional teams inside Facebook, product engineering managers, but at the same time with the level of empathy for businesses and help them succeed on our platform and so work closely with partners at that level.</p><h4 id="A-typical-day-of-an-engineer-at-Facebook"><a href="#A-typical-day-of-an-engineer-at-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="A typical day of an engineer at Facebook"></a>A typical day of an engineer at Facebook</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Excellent! Our first live question of the day: <strong>how does the typical day of an engineer at Facebook look like?</strong></p><p><strong>Flora</strong> I think there is no such thing as typical day, at least for a solutions engineer everyday is different. There are maybe days when I’m more focused on engineering, when I’m trying to focus on the project I’m working on, and maybe I even block out time to make sure that it happens. And there are other days when I may be visiting an advertiser at their office or meeting them in our office and the whole day’s focus is around that, so it’s pretty varied in my case at least.</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: Yeah same thing, I couldn’t answer it better. On my case there is no typical day. To expand on that I think for partner engineers, we have an easy way to structure our time and different people have different formats. There is no sort of box that you put yourself in. Typically a day would start with some meetings with partners.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: In the beginning of the week we figure out the work for the whole week and then towards the end of the week would be doing more maybe internal meetings with product teams to get an idea of where the product is headed, and also do some engineering work for which we usually try to block extended periods of time to not have a lot of context switching. It is again different for different people.</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: I think one point that’s interesting, in which you touched on, is that both solutions and partner engineering is very entrepreneurial. We expect people to set their own agenda, how they will go about their day. If that day client meetings is how you feel you’ll have the most impact, that’s the way to go about it. If this is a day you want to focus on coding that’s another possibility, but it’s up to you to find what is best for your goals.</p><h4 id="The-most-exciting-aspect-of-working-at-Facebook-on-client-facing-products"><a href="#The-most-exciting-aspect-of-working-at-Facebook-on-client-facing-products" class="headerlink" title="The most exciting aspect of working at Facebook on client facing products"></a>The most exciting aspect of working at Facebook on client facing products</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Yeah, I think you’re exactly right. The autonomy that you’re given in this role is probably second to none in a sense. We’ve had another live question: <strong>what is the most exciting aspect of working at Facebook on client facing products?</strong></p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: One example for me is that two or three months into the role I got called into a meeting set by sales people where we had the full afternoon for a specific client. I had a one hour discussion with them about how to set their technical strategy depending on their goals. I think this is not something you can do every day with the CEO of a company that is thriving in Italy. That was a very unique experience and within three months I was already ready to do that.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: Also the fact that if you are working on building something you straight away meet the people who will use that product. There’s a really short feedback loop that will tell you exactly what’s missing or what could be changed to make that product even more effective. Then it goes out to the thousands eventually, but you do meet those first users face to face, which is pretty exciting.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: Yeah, absolutely. The part where we get to have that level of empathy with businesses it’s also the part which leads to the most amount of success for partner engineers. It’s really understanding the business use case from the partner’s perspective, seeing what’s gonna make them successful, and then really taking a look at our products and saying “hey, does this make you successful or, if not, what else can be better to make you successful?”. On both of those sides there’s a diverging paths where we either proceed to work with our current set of products, help them integrate and get them to launch in closed beta or alpha. Or we would ship a prototype, we build it on stack and then we work with partners across the globe to get them on board.</p><h4 id="Solutions-Engineer-at-Facebook-compared-to-Solutions-Engineer-at-other-companies"><a href="#Solutions-Engineer-at-Facebook-compared-to-Solutions-Engineer-at-other-companies" class="headerlink" title="Solutions Engineer at Facebook compared to Solutions Engineer at other companies"></a>Solutions Engineer at Facebook compared to Solutions Engineer at other companies</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: There’s obviously people in the industry called <em>Solutions Engineers</em> or <em>Solutions Architects</em> or some other nomenclature around that in other the companies, but in Facebook the term means something very very different. Yannick, do you want to explain <strong>how a solutions engineer at Facebook differs from what an industry solutions engineer might be considered as?</strong></p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: This is a role I’ve only held at Facebook but I’ve had conversation with other solutions engineers across the industry. My understanding is that the expectation that we have of still being hands on, still coding and still building products is very unique to Facebook. Flora talked about having the short feedback loop, and it’s where we think we can build value and that’s why we want to keep the team this way.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: What I’ve also experienced, not necessarily with this title but similar titles, is that the fact that it’s client facing is way more direct and in other companies where I’ve been doing similar roles. I’ve had a similar role previously which was also client facing, but in reality most of the time I was communicating with a client working on something especially for the client, but through a Product Manager. At Facebook you are the Product Manager yourself in a sense so you can go and actually meet the even the CEO even of some companies, so it’s very unique to Facebook.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: I think the only thing that I would add as well is that we don’t build bespoke things for clients in a sense. We look at the problems a client has and the industry has on the back of that and work out if it is worth building a solution for the industry as a whole. In other roles like solutions engineering or architect roles at enterprise companies it’s about tailoring a solution to fit that client’s specific need. And that is exactly not what this job is at Facebook. If anything, it’s the opposite. You’re building new products for new industries on new industry challenges and I think that for me is one of the clearest differences between the two.</p><p>Speaking of that, what are the main products or industries that both teams work on? I guess we’ve kind of touched them already but just to clear it out, Yash, what would you say are the main products and industries that your team works on?</p><p><strong>Yash</strong> In terms of industries we span across all industries because we’re on the platform side. Then, of course, we have sister teams which focus on specific industries. For products I focus on platform products, which is a very generic term, but is comprised of Facebook Identity, Messenger, Spark AR, Portal and the business platform, which includes events, ticketing, movies and so on and so forth. And also Instagram Shopping and Instagram Direct Messaging. That’s a lot of products. From the sister team perspective we have teams which focus on Commerce, essentially experiences which will enable buy and sell relationships on our platform, and that team would typically work with partners at scale to bring those experiences and build those kind of solutions. In the media space they would work with music labels, sports, agencies (FIFA, for example). That’s all on the media side. Of course, big media companies as well, and also news agencies. There’s also gaming partnership and there is also payments. There’s a lot of different industry specific verticals, as I mentioned before, and there’s also this sort of broader developer focused area which is where I focus on, which spans across all the industries, but it’s focused more on product. The end goal is to get to product market fit for the specific variants that we are trying to release.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: [from the Solutions Engineering’s perspective] We tend to focus on the ad side of things. We are helping some of the ads products grow by finding the most relevant beta candidates, for example, but our goal is not to grow a certain product. Our goal is always when we work with a certain advertiser to help them, so it’s not about the products it’s more of us knowing a little bit about each product so that we can recommend the best for the use case.</p><h4 id="Core-problem-Solutions-Partners-Engineers-try-to-solve"><a href="#Core-problem-Solutions-Partners-Engineers-try-to-solve" class="headerlink" title="Core problem Solutions/Partners Engineers try to solve"></a>Core problem Solutions/Partners Engineers try to solve</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: <strong>What are the core problems or challenges that your team are trying to solve?</strong></p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: It’s a very wide-ranging question. It will depend on which industry we’re working on and what products this advertiser is using. For me, in the automotive industry, it’s about trying to get the most relevant vehicles in front of the relevant person, so that they see the cars they are most likely interested in. But that’s one client and one type of industry. My role in this is usually about helping the clients move forward. The automotive industry is a slow-moving one so I will try to help their tech teams to understand how they can best build value for the marketing team and how they can work together and reach their goals.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: I think one of our main goal is also that Facebook users see very relevant ads so they don’t consider it as spam but actually a useful use of their time. That they get presented that product they never heard about but they are actually interested in.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: For partnerships we’re focused on the developer side to create unique and meaningful experiences. How do we get a partner who isn’t completely integrated with our platform, to use or leverage our platform and then drive growth in their business? Help them and therefore help other future partners to unlock the side of Facebook that really works for people, which is our social network.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: I would add, from my point of view from the small to medium business space, that creative is such a big problem. With Facebook you have obviously the stories with vertical format, you have the landscape format, you have video, and you have all of these different creative challenges. I think one of the things that the solutions engineering team is really thinking about is how can you simplify and how can you democratize creative in a way that all of these formats and these ways of expressing yourself are available really easily to the biggest advertisers in the world, but also to the smallest advertisers who don’t have a creative department. I think that’s another big pillar that I just wanted to call out for our team.</p><h4 id="The-tech-stack"><a href="#The-tech-stack" class="headerlink" title="The tech stack"></a>The tech stack</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Since we all work on the same customers at the end of the day, and we all work on the sort of same infrastructure, the next question is “**what’s the tech stack we most often use?**” and I imagine it’s the same for all three of us. Who wants to cover our tech stack?</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: Facebook has a Facebook tech stack. We have reinvented a lot of industry products: we’ve made PHP evolve and use Hack instead, we have our own servers and our own IDEs and database systems, and we invented React. It’s a very Facebook tech stack, but what’s important to note is that we don’t expect anybody to come in and be proficient with our tech stack. We have a very intensive ramp up at the beginning where we get to learn how to use our technologies and we expect anybody who meets our expectations to be, in a way, technology agnostic and be able to operate in any language, and they will be able to learn.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: Absolutely. We expect people to be full stack, as most of us are. Since we have so many options, it’s really about seeing how best we can leverage them for the partner. If it’s an API based technology, or if it’s an SDK, does the SDK live on web, is it on mobile, can we build that across the platform, can we build it for Android and iOS and JavaScript…? Again, platform completely agnostic. The focus is on the end goal here, the objectives, and technology is just a tool to get us there.</p><h4 id="Variety-and-diversity-at-the-role-Global-collaboration"><a href="#Variety-and-diversity-at-the-role-Global-collaboration" class="headerlink" title="Variety and diversity at the role. Global collaboration."></a>Variety and diversity at the role. Global collaboration.</h4><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: You’ve all touched on it in very different ways, but it’s very clear that our teams are very multifaceted roles. We have to wear many hats throughout the day and we have to do many things. Which part of it is your favorite? If you have to pick one thing to call out about the role that’s your favorite, what would it be?</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: I think the variety itself. I really enjoy that that my days are different and even within the day sometimes there is a switch between two different hats, from the client-facing work, the technology work, and also maybe recruiting, which I would also account and is a quite different aspect of the role. I quite enjoy being able to do all of these.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: For me, working at Facebook allows me to work with some of the smartest people in the world, and for me that’s a very compelling reason to show up at work every day.</p><p>I live at walking distance from the office and I like walking fast. It’s one of those subtle indicators that your your job means more than a job. You’re looking forward to meeting people, you’re looking forward to working with your colleagues. A part of that is the challenging environment when you’re working with so many highly talented people.</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: I think one point that you’re kind of touching on, and that is really core in our team, is the diversity of the team. We are in Europe, in a team of about 30 people and we probably have 10 to 15 nationalities and different backgrounds. On top of that not everybody is sitting in the same office. I’m in Paris, a big part of the team is in London, we have people in Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dublin and Stockholm. That also brings a diversity to the team, and even beyond that the global Sol Eng team. We work with North America pretty frequently, with Asia-Pacific, with Latin America. That also gives us a range of vision that we can’t get in most roles.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong> Yeah, I think that’s a great point. Following on from that we have Ping on the line, who is from our Singapore office. He’s currently in EMEA, so we haven’t asked him to stay awake until 1 a.m. Singapore time. Ping, thank you very much for joining us on this live. I want to ask you how often do your teams get to work on global projects and collaborate across different regions. And if you have an example that you could share I’d love to hear about it.</p><p><strong>Ping</strong>: Sure! For giving you a background, I’m one of the Solutions Engineers and I’m based in Singapore but I cover Singapore and Thailand. Even if I stay in Singapore I have a lot of opportunities to work with our global teams. For example currently I’m working on a product where I have to work with a team in the U.S., so I’m working with them almost every single day. Additionally, not just only building the products because when we build the products, they eventually have to be used globally, so I have to work with many different teams around the world. For example I work with Flora, with Jordan, I ping them to ask for help, I try to give some consultation for the product that I’m proficient in.</p><p>Working with different regions is one of the most favorite part of my job. I think it’s very fascinating.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Flora, anything you want to add about the cross regional collaboration that we have?</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: Yes. I actually worked with Ping on a project, which is a very typical example of a great product that was prototyped by our team. It’s called Collaborative Ads, and it has now been taken over by product team but we are still very much involved. It’s still in beta mode and we are helping onboarding the first clients. I’ve cooperated with Ping on this project quite extensively.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Well, just before you go Ping, an impromptu question from me: <strong>what is your favorite thing about solutions engineering?</strong></p><p><strong>Ping</strong>: I think this is very unique role. Like you said, we are in the middle, we are like in-market engineers. We don’t do just coding, but also client-facing. I love to talk with clients and provide consultation and I’m very happy when I see my clients solve their problems.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Excellent! Thank you Ping for joining us in this live today and enjoy the rest of your travels here in EMEA.</p><p><strong>Ping</strong>: Thank you, Jordan!</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: We have another live question. I’m gonna put this to Yash: how do you maintain the balance between what the partners want and the business roadmap?</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: That’s a really good question. I would say in some ways both inform each other, but that’s not really the answer. They do inform each other but it is also our job to see how both of them can fit in a way where we can make both business and partners happy at the same time. That’s a really tricky position to be in. A framework that I give people in my team, and that we have as partner engineers, is to really think about it as subproblems and not to focus on the whole business. If you’re working with a partner and let’s say their end goal might be increase their revenue or sale, we want to get more users on board, we want to increase the retention, or customer satisfaction…</p><p>We really try to break it down to a sub-problem that fits in nicely with a sub-objective or business goal. That’s where you’ll usually find a match of one to one. Even if you can provide value across something which might seem small, as increasing customer satisfaction, if implemented properly, if measured properly, that is a very powerful to be implementing, prototyping and launching in the ecosystem. Because something as small as increasing customer satisfaction or retention can go a long way in a business’s roadmap. We really try not to think of as “oh we want to solve all your problems” for product or for business. We really try to break it down into smaller problems. It’s a core philosophy.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Excellent, excellent. We’ve had another open question: <strong>can we recruit in India?</strong>. The simple answer is that we hire for Asia-Pacific into Singapore but we do relocate people from all over the world to work in Singapore. Please do check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/locations/singapore/">the careers page for the Singapore office</a> and see if anything there is what you would be interested into applying for. Then the recruiter or the person you would speak to would be able to talk to you about relocation and how that process would work from India. Just because Facebook doesn’t have a necessarily an engineering office in any country, so not just India, there are many countries where we don’t have engineering offices, that doesn’t mean you couldn’t join Facebook by applying and being relocated. Don’t let that put you off applying.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: In fact, just to add to that, we never consider a candidate’s location as a criteria for anything in the interview process. It’s not something that we would even look at or consider or be like “oh, this person is closer and can onboard quicker” or “this person is further away, it will take time”. That’s never a concern. I am speaking for the cross Facebook not just part of engineering. That’s usually a concern with a lot of other companies but Facebook feels that we invest in people and so we don’t really care about it.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: In your opinion, <strong>what makes a good client facing engineer?</strong>, <strong>what are the skills you’re looking for in a candidate?</strong> We’ve touched on that the team is a mixture of entrepreneurs and people have certain mindsets, so what is it that you guys think you’re looking for and what skills people should have in these types of roles?</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: Clearly you have to start with a passion for the job. You have to want to be facing clients. I know some people are not wanting those kinds of interactions. That’s have to be the core of it. You also have to love coding and be passionate about technology as we all are on the team. And finally I think the skill that is very important is the ability to juggle between those two. These are two very different types of schedules: coding is something that we want to do calmly in the long term, and client interactions can be very fast paced. Being able to juggle your schedule and handle these kinds of contrasts will be very important as well.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: I think that’s a perfect answer and covers my area as well. If I had to choose one quality or skill or something that a person should have to be successful at this job from a client perspective, is empathy. Without a doubt, empathy is number 1, 2, and 3. That’s core to the job. It will break down a lot of walls and a lot of barriers in your way of getting through to the client.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Do you guys think that someone from a pure SWE (Software Engineer) background can be successful in these types of roles?</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: There is no limitation on that. If you have a pure SWE background and you’ve only done technical things, which is my case, you can still, if you have the appetite towards it, become a Solution Engineer. If you want to have those client interaction and if it’s something you already can do. If you’re a good communicator, independently of whether it’s been client facing or not, that can be a very good stepping stone to become a Solutions Engineer.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: One important thing is that you could be also “client facing” internally. For example, in one of my previous roles, I was working for an investment bank and I was sitting on the trading floor working very closely with the traders. Even though they were working for the same company they were still speaking a very different language to my teammates who were very tactical. I think that skill is quite important to be able to explain concepts in a non-technical way to non-technical people, and also give their feedback to the product teams.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: I might have lost people when I said the word SWE. SWE within Facebook means our core software engineering teams. Thus, the question was more aligned with <em>what is the skillset around a core software engineer and would that be someone who would be successful in partner engineering or solutions engineering?</em>. To summarize the answers I think that if you have the passion for working with clients it doesn’t matter if you haven’t done that before. If you can demonstrate that you want to be client facing and you want to communicate and want to work with people to solve real business challenges, that’s enough to be able to get your foot in the door and start that journey.</p><h4 id="How-much-experience-is-needed-for-the-role"><a href="#How-much-experience-is-needed-for-the-role" class="headerlink" title="How much experience is needed for the role"></a>How much experience is needed for the role</h4><p>We have another live question. Along the same lines of skills and software engineer and not software engineering, “<strong>how much experience is usually needed to have a chance at joining Facebook? it seems like Facebook is mostly looking for quite experienced people</strong>“. What do you guys say to that?</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: Honestly on our team, and I don’t know if it’s been a goal or not, we have hired at a very fairly experienced level, like five to ten years is pretty standard to us. We have hired some new grads, some people fresh out of the university, but we tend to hire more on the more experienced side. That said, we do have the internship program and we have interns that come in which have zero experience at their building experience and some of them get hired. So while we do skew towards more experienced it’s also possible to come with less experience on the team.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: We do have some graduates roles open currently as well. As the team grows now we can actually afford to have different levels of experience in the team.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: On that point, if you are a graduate or you are looking to join Facebook as a graduate, you can go on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/students-and-grads/?teams%5B0%5D=Internship%20-%20Engineering,%20Tech%20&%20Design&teams%5B1%5D=Internship%20-%20Business&teams%5B2%5D=Internship%20-%20PhD&teams%5B3%5D=University%20Grad%20-%20PhD%20&%20Postdoc&teams%5B4%5D=University%20Grad%20-%20Engineering,%20Tech%20&%20Design&teams%5B5%5D=University%20Grad%20-%20Business#openpositions">our University page today and see the open graduate roles</a> that we have available in EMEA at our London office. And we also do an internship every summer as well, so you can join for instance as someone who is in university still, as someone who’s just graduated, and someone who is an industry hire. I guess it’s the same for you, Yash?</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: Yeah, going with Yannick on this one. We do tend to skew towards more experienced people. I think partner engineering is one of those roles where, unlike core software engineering, you really spend some time in the industry to figure out if that’s something you want to do. I don’t think that as a fresh computer science graduate that’s something that comes very naturally. We have in the past of course recruited fairly early IC levels but we tend to skew towards people with at least five years of experience.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Could you just elaborate on IC levels?</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: Yes. At Facebook we have two tracks: individual contributors and management tracks. The unique thing about Facebook is that you don’t have to be a manager to grow, you can grow as an IC. Our teams have grown big enough that we now allow for sufficient growth, the career path is pretty solid in that sense. It’s hard to, in two lines, give a framework for how you get to senior IC levels. A model to think about is the level of influence you have internally and externally and as that grows you grew as an IC. Of course along the way you pick up some skillset that really help you get there.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Great answer. We’ve kind of touched on the internships at the moment and I just want to go a bit deeper on that so <strong>what does an internship at Facebook within solutions engineering?</strong>. Well, I’ll answer this one because I was an intern manager last year. What that looks like is you join Facebook and you’ll get given a certain project and within that project you will have a couple of milestones. So your milestones may be to, in the first 4 weeks, understand your project and start building it. In sort of the second 4 weeks, is really to finish it off or scale it out to an extent where it works and it’s code complete and you’re able to deliver that potentially to a client. The last 4 weeks we really look for that client facing / entrepreneurial skill which is how you can take this project and potentially expand it, or work with clients to get it adopted or integrate it with a couple of test partners. It’s a lot to try and do in 12 weeks but roughly that’s how we run our internships in those 3 buckets. That’s how we’re doing on solutions engineering. (to Yash) Do you guys have an internship program on partners?</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: We currently don’t have an internship program. I’m sorry.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: You, Yash, touched on career growth for what it looks like for the partner engineering team. Yannick, as a solutions engineering manager, <strong>how do you think about growing the careers of the people in your team?</strong></p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: That’s a very good question. Like Yash said we have these two tracks about individual contributors and manager. You have to grow your impact basically. At Facebook, what we want to see is not how much effort you put but how much impact you have. Usually at the most senior IC levels will have an understanding of how clients work or how the industry works, and will be able to influence in a larger scope how Facebook interacts with those clients, how products will better fit the clients, and have more value there. Growth is a very strong factor for us managers, this is something we talk aboutwith our team we regularly, and we want everybody to grow and to reach the level where they want to be at.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Flora, as a fellow individual contributor, <strong>how do you think about your growth?</strong></p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: I think there is a lot of space to grow within this role. I don’t feel I’m at the maximum yet. Seeing your career, Jordan, is quite inspiring for me. I’ve seen how you’ve move between roles within our team and tried different things. Even though I haven’t changed, I do feel how my impact is growing as Yannick said and how I’m more confident with certain things. If I ever get to a level where I’m bored there are different hats you could wear within solutions engineering. I guess there is also the option to move towards the manager track for anyone who is interested. We’ve even seen people leave the team for other similar teams, for example to partner engineering.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: That’s a good call. I think it’s worth knowing that internal mobility at Facebook is strongly encouraged. You can join a team and your the team would be very sad if you were to leave, but it’s not something that your manager or the team would ever hold you back from. If you wanted to change roles you would be encouraged and supported and given that opportunity to do that. So if you join as a solutions engineer and after 4 years decided you wanted to change roles you would be encouraged to do that and supported by your manager throughout. I think that is a another really important thing about the culture that we have a Facebook, that is encouraged and never suppressed. I think that’s really important.</p><h4 id="What-projects-we-work-on"><a href="#What-projects-we-work-on" class="headerlink" title="What projects we work on"></a>What projects we work on</h4><p>Changing tag slightly, <strong>tell us about some of the exciting projects that you’ve worked on recently</strong>.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: Sure, I can go first. One of the projects I could talk about is for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/success/2-LEGO">a Messenger bot that my team built with Lego</a>. Lego is a great partner for Facebook, everybody loves Lego. They wanted to use our Messenger platform as a way to identify people who would be the right users, that were consumers for certain Lego products. That was a business challenge that they had that and they presented. It was something that our team took on. We served both business and product. We engaged Lego, we engaged a third party company which would actually be doing a lot of the building of the bot, and then people on our team were creating these prototypes for analytics SDK, which we would install on their server, to measure the impact and help them improve the flow of the Messenger bot. The bot was so successful that Lego announced it at their earnings call last year and it’s still one the most popular Messenger bots on the platform. It’s again one of those things where the partners succeeded and we succeeded in testing out some of our closed beta products that are now going into production. So win-win for everyone.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Excellent! Flora, Yannick? What would you say is your favorite project so far?</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: I guess my favorite one is the one I’m currently working. What we tend to do currently in solutions engineering is partner up. Each of us is like a point of contact towards one of the product teams. I’m the point of contact of a team called Cross-Border Business and they have a lot of products which are trying to make our ad products more international so that they deliver automatically in the right language and displaying the right price for each Facebook user. Working closely with them I’ve realized that one of their products I am a big believer in but when I was trying to convince the advertisers I work with to try this product they were bringing up some technical barriers. I’m currently working on a project to remove this barrier and I’m pretty excited about that. It’s like my own idea, my own baby, and it seems that it’s something that will have a lot of people excited internally and externally as well.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Excellent! We have another live question. Cassandra (who has sent the question) has experience, but she doesn’t have ten years of experience. She got a BSC in computer science in 2008 but was delayed in getting into programming for about four or five years. I don’t think, Cassandra, that would be a major problem. When I joined Facebook for instance I’d only been in the industry for two or three years and I applied and passed the interviews. I think the biggest piece of advice I could give you there would be that, if you are interested in joining, just put in the time, put in the effort, put in the practice of doing the questions of the algorithms, of the data structures, that you’re gonna face when you come to interview. And if you do the study and you do the homework it will demonstrate itself when you come to interview. I wouldn’t necessarily let the lack of industry experience put you off. And then the second part, <strong>is there a way that people can contribute to Facebook’s open source projects?</strong>. We obviously have <a href="https://github.com/facebook">a GitHub page</a>, and we’ve mentioned a couple of the open-source things that we’ve had like <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and I think the answer tonight is yes. Like any open source project, we have teams that look after these projects and if you submit pull requests and they get reviewed and accepted and merged in you will be a contributor to these projects like anyone else would be, like you can with any open source project. Go and see if there’s a way you can improve it or things you can fix or help with and try and contribute as best you can.</p><h4 id="Top-tips-for-interviewing"><a href="#Top-tips-for-interviewing" class="headerlink" title="Top tips for interviewing"></a>Top tips for interviewing</h4><p>Speaking of interviewing there, I gave one of the top tips that I would have, which is to practice, rehearse, study, and make sure that you put the time. <strong>What would be your top tips for interviewing?</strong>.</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: One of the things that we do at Facebook, that I don’t think any other company does, is the recruiter who will be with you along the process is really rooting for you and helping you prepare for the interview. Jordan gave some great tips about preparing for the tech interview but there will be also a business interview, a manager interview, etc. And for all these you have to prepare as well and the recruiter who will be in contact with you will tell you exactly what these interviews are about, and how you can best prepare for them. Our goal is to see you at your best and not catch you off-guard with some unforeseen type of question.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: I just like to emphasize the practice point. Even though you might be coding everyday in your job you you have to prepare for these interviews. You have to prepare solving this kind of quirky logical questions for the tech interview, maybe on a paper as well. I like to mimic the environment you would have in an interview. It’s not quite the same as doing a day to day software engineer job I would say.</p><p><strong>Yash</strong>: I think just follow what they said. As far as algorithms and programming are concerned, we also have a loop on architecture, which we call “a pirate round”, and then that typically is something that I would say is a bit harder to prepare for, but you can prepare for it. A good way to look at that stage of the interview is that we typically try to find out your knowledge of systems end to end and, and how you think about scaling the solution. Again, it’s not going into the level where we expect you to build Spotify or something, it’s not like we expect you to build a system to serve billions of people, you’ll learn about those when you come to Facebook. What we really want to understand conceptually is that you have enough insights on trade-offs that can be made in a system and this goes to our job as well. In the end you want to make sure that you’re successful at the job here. A part of a very core part of our job is to work with partners and our internal tech stack to make sure that we are logically making those trade-offs, if and when we are scaling a solution for a partner. Everything that we do has a reason and, because we are agnostic to tech stack, we focus more on the fundamentals.</p><p><strong>Yannick</strong>: One point I’d like to make on this is the tech level that we expect isn’t any different for solutions engineer than it is for software engineers. We are open to people moving around and if you want to go from solutions engineering to software engineering that has to be possible, but that means that we expect the same level of tech proficiency in solutions engineering than any other tech role and so the same for partner engineering. We have the same loops with the same sort of format of questions.</p><p><strong>Flora</strong>: And we are touching the same codebase so yeah it’s not okay to introduce this bug in Facebook because it was done by a solutions engineer and not a software engineer. We have to be to the same level.</p><p><strong>Jordan</strong>: Yeah, I think the final thing that I’ll add would be a small story about how I made a mistake during this which was that I wasn’t necessarily my authentic self when I was interviewing, I came to the interview thinking that the expectation would be to look smart, so I wore a shirt and a jumper and trousers and shoes. I was so hot, I was sweating for the whole three or four interviews and it was as well a high-pressure experience, a very uncomfortable personal experience as well. I think the final thing I would say for interviewing is just be yourself. Facebook has a culture of bringing your authentic self to work and that applies not just when you get to Facebook but during the interview process as well. It’s just be yourself because the interviews are hard enough, let alone trying to act like someone you’re not.</p><p>That’s pretty much all we had today on our live session so if from any of the questions that you’ve had or from watching this you feel like you want to come and apply and join our teams, please go and check out <a href="https://facebook.com/careers/">the careers website on Facebook</a>.</p><p>I just want to thank everybody for watching and I want to thank you for all of the questions and comments today. I want to thank Flora, Yannick, and Ash for giving us all of the insightful answers that you had, and I just want to say thank you all again and have a great rest of your day everybody,or a great morning depending on where you are in the world.</p>]]></content>

    <title>What PWAs for Desktop means for Users and Developers</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As Progressive Web Apps make their way on desktop I wanted to talk about why I consider this is a breakthrough. I have talked in the past <a href="/shades-of-pwa/">about different uses cases for PWA</a>. In this post I want to focus on PWAs for desktop.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:76.47%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1552998597/spotify-pwa-mac_szshj0.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1552998597/spotify-pwa-mac_szshj0.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1552998597/spotify-pwa-mac_szshj0.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1552998597/spotify-pwa-mac_szshj0.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1552998597/spotify-pwa-mac_szshj0.png"    alt="A screenshot of Spotify's Web Player running as Progressive Web App" /></div><p>The current version of Google Chrome stable is Chrome 73. This version <a href="https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1105599978880331777">lets you install Progressive Web Apps natively on macOS</a>. You can find more information about the release on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/03/nic73#pwas-everywhere">Pete LePage’s “New in Chrome 73” notes</a>.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Wasn’t this possible before? Well, yes. On Chrome 72 the only option was to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/#listen_for_beforeinstallprompt">wait for a <code>beforeinstallprompt</code> event</a> to then show some button on your page to let the user install the website as a PWA. Since version 73 users can install the PWA directly from Chrome’s context menu.</p><p>Now, going back to why this is a milestone. <a href="https://twitter.com/jmperezperez/status/1107565909906997250">I recently tweeted about how to install Spotify’s web player as a PWA</a> using Chrome’s context menu.</p><p>I got this great question:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What benefit does this give you vs the regular downloaded desktop app? (Sorry for the ignorance 😅)</p>&mdash; Functor Flavius 𝝺 (@FlavioCorpa) <a href="https://twitter.com/FlavioCorpa/status/1107782132791947271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">18 March 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2 id="Understanding-What-to-Optimize-for"><a href="#Understanding-What-to-Optimize-for" class="headerlink" title="Understanding What to Optimize for"></a>Understanding What to Optimize for</h2><p>If you are working on a new website you will see that PWAs for desktop is a nice addition to your site. Users who want to run it as a desktop app can do it. This has some obvious benefits, nicely summarized on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop">Pete LePage’s “Desktop Progressive Web Apps” article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>They’re fast. Feel integrated because they launched in the same way as other apps, and run in an app window, without an address bar or tabs. They’re reliable because service workers can cache all of the assets they need to run. And they create an engaging experience for users.</p></blockquote><p>If you have been working on a project that was a desktop app, the question can be the opposite: <strong>“What benefit does a desktop app gives you vs the website?”</strong>. We have seen this battle over and over again on the mobile landscape, with apps vs mobile web. The main advantage of an app is its discoverability, through the Play Store / App Store, but more than that is the presence on your home screen. When you install the app on your phone it’s there on your grid of apps. You will see the icon easily and you will open it with just a tap. You might get notifications if you opt-in, which will be a good way for the app owner to let you re-engage with you. Doing this on the web is possible, but more difficult. The discoverability is less straightforward. Knowing that a web site can be installed is not that obvious.</p><p>Discoverability is great, but companies look at other important metrics that installable apps excel at against the web: <strong>retention and engagement</strong>. If you have a shortcut to an app on your home screen you will be more likely to use the app than if you don’t have it. Same thing if you get push notifications. And in the case of Spotify’s desktop application you will even get the app open automatically when you start your computer. It’s difficult not to engage with it.</p><p>For services with both app and website there is also another aspect that is usually disregarded. Users that have downloaded and installed your app have higher intention of using the app than those that only only the web version. It’s natural to think that the end goal is to take users to the platform that has better metrics, so the web is usually seen as a place to put banners and modals that beg the user to install the app.</p><p>What is ignored is that in the way towards the installable app <strong>there will be many users abandoning because they don’t want to, or can’t, download and install the app</strong>.</p><p>Retention and engagement was one of the reasons why Spotify keeps developing a desktop application, but also capabilities. A desktop application allowed performant music streaming in the days when network was the bottleneck. It also let premium users download music to be played offline. And it also had a much better integration with the operating system (eg adding custom buttons to the Touch Bar on MacOS, or custom taskbar buttons on Windows).</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1552998304/spotify-mac-touch-bar_q7ywci.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1552998304/spotify-mac-touch-bar_q7ywci.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1552998304/spotify-mac-touch-bar_q7ywci.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1552998304/spotify-mac-touch-bar_q7ywci.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1552998304/spotify-mac-touch-bar_q7ywci.jpg"    alt="Picture of a Macbook Pro running the Spotify app, with custom controls in the Touch Bar" /></div><h2 id="What-the-Web-can-Do"><a href="#What-the-Web-can-Do" class="headerlink" title="What the Web can Do"></a>What the Web can Do</h2><p>The web has been ticking off most of these. Take for instance offline capabilities with encrypted content which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--KA2VrPDao">Paul Lewis explained how to implement two years ago</a>.</p><p>For companies that currently have 2 implementations of their service, one as an app and another as a website, the question should be “is the cost of developing 2 different versions of the same thing worth it?”. And in most cases PWA for desktop means that, at least on desktop, there is no strong advantage in having the overhead of developing multiple versions. This is especially true in the case that the code base of these versions differs greatly, as in the case of Spotify’s desktop app and web player.</p><p>The web has also a couple of great benefits over a hybrid app on desktop. Push notifications encourage users to go back to your site even if it’s not open currently on a browser. And more importantly, the web makes it extremely easy to deliver feature updates and fixes (bug fixes, security fixes, code roll backs). No need to go through release cycles nor app store approvals. Having every user on the latest version is a great perk that should be more appreciated.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As I wanted to highlight, for the user the good news is that there are no news. They can install a PWA as a desktop application and won’t miss any “truly desktop app” capabilities. For a company, though, this can save a lot of duplicated work, help their developers move faster and deliver the best experience for the user regardless of their device.</p><p>Because the web was always great for this.</p>]]></content>

Still, in our development teams we continue to prioritize more highly shipping features over addressing web performance.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, features are important. Serving an empty site is fast, but not very useful. It’s important to deliver a core set of features, and do it in such a way that many users can enjoy it. Just keep in mind that if they user can’t use the product we will lose them, no matter how much we have worked on the feature set.</p><h2 id="Our-role-promoting-performance"><a href="#Our-role-promoting-performance" class="headerlink" title="Our role promoting performance"></a>Our role promoting performance</h2><p>Developers play a key role in prioritizing performance. They can steer what tasks the development team works on, and they can prove with results the impact of the changes.</p><p>While some performance improvements might be costly in time, there are usually lots of low-hanging fruits that can drive to big improvements. And we are more prepared than ever to do a good job.</p><p>We have a better understanding of how the browser and network works, and how to serve content to the user without incurring in delays. We also use tools to build our sites that help us defining dependencies and delivering a small payload, tailored to the current session.</p><h2 id="Taking-advantage-of-modern-tools"><a href="#Taking-advantage-of-modern-tools" class="headerlink" title="Taking advantage of modern tools"></a>Taking advantage of modern tools</h2><p>Single Page Applications and the trend of moving most of the logic to the client comes with performance implications. There is now more work to do in the browser, like data-fetching, templating or routing, which makes sites slower out-of-the-box. If we don’t stop there and explore the beauty of component-based sites we will see that <a href="/high-performance-lazy-loading/">code-splitting and lazy-loading</a> fit perfectly in the picture and they allow us, for the first time, to be smart on how we ship code while keeping complexity at a minimum.</p><p>While it can be difficult to keep track of every new tool and browser API, it’s important to be aware of them. It wouldn’t be smart to jump immediately on them and rewrite constantly our product on the latest and trendiest stack, but we can learn something from them.</p><p>I get inspired by tools like <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> or <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a>. They let us build sites that have a high performance out of the box. What they do is not black magic, but making a good job serving what is needed for the current page, and deferred the loading of the rest of the content. Nothing prevents us from adopting some of those techniques to our projects to give them a boost.</p><h2 id="The-web-that-is-coming"><a href="#The-web-that-is-coming" class="headerlink" title="The web that is coming"></a>The web that is coming</h2><p>The future looks bright.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I expected, this year I have dedicated more time to my family and less to side projects. I have been on parental leave for 7 months and it has been a great time to put things in perspective.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="Blogging"><a href="#Blogging" class="headerlink" title="Blogging"></a>Blogging</h2><p>During 2018 I wrote 8 blog posts. This is way lower than <a href="/my-2017/">last year</a>.</p><p>The main highlight was that I got to publish <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/progressive-image-loading-user-perceived-performance/">a post on Smashing Magazine on user perceived performance</a>. I enjoyed the experience a lot and their support helped me writing posts with a better structure. I also like seeing that it gets referenced in posts <a href="https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2018/improving-perceived-performance-web-app/">like this from Perfplanet’s Performance Calendar</a>.</p><h2 id="Side-projects"><a href="#Side-projects" class="headerlink" title="Side projects"></a>Side projects</h2><p>I started a project with <a href="https://twitter.com/nucliweb">Joan León (aka @nucliweb)</a> to do performance reviews of web sites and explain our findings as videos. We both like talking about performance and realized that lots of developers don’t know where to start when improving it, and lots of stakeholders in general don’t give performance the importance it deserves.</p><p>The videos are in Spanish and we want to take it as an opportunity to make it easier for a huge community to access knowledge that exists mainly in English. If you are interested in having a look, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNoF5_1loBFvW2lZXPxp8ww">our channel on Youtube</a>.</p><h2 id="Conferences"><a href="#Conferences" class="headerlink" title="Conferences"></a>Conferences</h2><p>This year I spoke at <a href="/pitercss-2018/">PiterCSS in Saint Petersburg</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-ReactJS-Meetup/events/253918039/">ReactJS in Stockholm</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-Google-Developer-Group/events/255690962/">GDG in Stockholm</a>, and <a href="https://noti.st/jmperez/bSkEUc/better-performance-for-component-based-web-apps">Codemotion in Madrid</a>.</p><h2 id="Certifications"><a href="#Certifications" class="headerlink" title="Certifications"></a>Certifications</h2><p>I became a <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/people/jose-manuel-perez-perez">Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies</a>, which got me in contact with an amazing community of developers who are pushing the web forward in different fronts. It’s also great to have contacts from Google at hand to know more about their web initiatives.</p><h2 id="Work"><a href="#Work" class="headerlink" title="Work"></a>Work</h2><p>Parental leave meant changes for me. I came to the conclusion that I wanted to make a professional move after 6+ years working at Spotify. I still don’t know if I just loved my work too much or became too attached to some projects I wanted to see succeed (which they did). Truth is that I woke up some day and realized I needed to push myself a bit enough out of my comfort zone, and that would bring positive experiences.</p><h2 id="What’s-next-in-2019"><a href="#What’s-next-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="What’s next in 2019?"></a>What’s next in 2019?</h2><p>In a few days I will start working at Facebook and I’m excited to take on new challenges. It will be a new role for me, taking a step back from the web, looking at a bigger picture to use technology to unlock business opportunities.</p><p>This is a big change for me and I’m looking forward to find out what the future looks like.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Implementing a PWA or adapting an existing site to “become a PWA” can be daunting. There are many new technologies to learn about, but you don’t need to use all of them to improve your website performance and user experience greatly.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:66.6666%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1541172389/shades-of-pwa/header.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1541172389/shades-of-pwa/header.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1541172389/shades-of-pwa/header.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1541172389/shades-of-pwa/header.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1541172389/shades-of-pwa/header.jpg"    alt="" /></div><p>On this post I will describe several use cases where Progressive Web Apps (PWA) can be useful to make your website achieve better performance and be more reliable.</p><span id="more"></span><h2 id="What-are-Progressive-Web-Apps"><a href="#What-are-Progressive-Web-Apps" class="headerlink" title="What are Progressive Web Apps"></a>What are Progressive Web Apps</h2><p>If you are a web developer you have probably heard about Progressive Web Apps (PWA). Web sites that load quick, are reliable, feel smooth and take advantage of modern APIs.</p><p>There is a lot of buzz about them, partly because Google coined the term and has been leading the implementation of the bits and pieces that composed it.</p><p>Implementing a PWA or adapting an existing site to “become a PWA” looks like a big endeavor. The same powerful marketing that has made PWA known in the developer community can be a blessing and a curse. Developers might get the wrong idea that either they use everything and make installable offline-capable push notifications-enabled websites, or they bail out. After all, <strong>PWA is just a way to coin a set of recent browser APIs and techniques, not all or nothing</strong>.</p><p>Every website’s use case is different and that is alright. If installing your website as an app is not something a user would do for your site, you don’t need to build that capability. <strong>You can still take advantage of some of the technologies powering PWAs</strong>. The main requirement is that your site runs on HTTPS and, in most cases, creating a ServiceWorker, which is not more than a Javascript file.</p><p>I want to describe some of the typical scenarios where you can applied elements from PWAs.</p><h2 id="Common-Use-Cases-to-Apply-Service-Workers-and-other-PWA-related-functionality"><a href="#Common-Use-Cases-to-Apply-Service-Workers-and-other-PWA-related-functionality" class="headerlink" title="Common Use Cases to Apply Service Workers and other PWA-related functionality"></a>Common Use Cases to Apply Service Workers and other PWA-related functionality</h2><h3 id="Offline-mode-and-pre-caching"><a href="#Offline-mode-and-pre-caching" class="headerlink" title="Offline mode and pre-caching"></a>Offline mode and pre-caching</h3><p>To get your site to load without a connection, the user needs to visit it and the site needs to run a Service Worker (SW)that will make content available offline. The SW can follow different strategies (eg serving cache first, making a network request first, etc). You can find strategies on <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/">Jake Archibald’s Offline Cookbook</a> and <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/">serviceworke.rs</a>.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:49%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1541172749/shades-of-pwa/stale-while-revalidate-sw.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1541172749/shades-of-pwa/stale-while-revalidate-sw.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1541172749/shades-of-pwa/stale-while-revalidate-sw.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1541172749/shades-of-pwa/stale-while-revalidate-sw.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1541172749/shades-of-pwa/stale-while-revalidate-sw.png"    alt="Stale-while-revalidate” strategy, of the many explained on Jake Archibald’s Offline Cookbook" /></div><p><small class="caption">“Stale-while-revalidate” strategy, of the many explained on <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/">Jake Archibald’s Offline Cookbook</a>.

Only minor interactions used Javascript in the client. Every page navigation meant a full page load.</li><li> Then we started creating more complex web experiences and moved all the logic (and templates) to client-side land. Everything was amazing as long as you waited a bit while staring at a blank page whose main purpose was to load a large JS bundle.</li><li> We realized that maybe we needed a hybrid solution. First request server-side rendered, then the rest happening client-side.</li></ol><p><strong>Reaching the third step involves doing server-side rendering.</strong> If you don’t want to duplicate templates and logic, the usual solution is to use NodeJS on the server. This is fun for web developers because we get to use the same language both on server and browser. In medium and large web projects it means rewriting existing working code from python/java/PHP/others to Javascript, and the typical nuances of adopting something different from the existing solution.</p><p>Server-side rendered sites have also a largely underestimated drawback. <strong>Putting content early on the screen is one thing. Making the content interactive is another.</strong> A page that renders quickly but then doesn’t respond to click/touch for seconds, while loads and executes the JS behemoth, results in frustration.</p><p>In web dev terms we are improving the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-meaningful-paint">First Meaningful Paint</a> (‘FMP’), but we aren’t making any improvement in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive">Time to Interactive</a> (‘TTI’).</p><p>This short version of Addy Osmani’s “The cost of JavaScript“ explains it very well:</p><div class="videoWrapper">    <iframe width="1764" height="1080" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qUFA1pAMfj4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUFA1pAMfj4">The cost of JavaScript</a>” by Addy Osmani.

An image from “<a href="https://aerotwist.com/blog/when-everything-is-important-nothing-is/">When everything is important nothing is</a>”.</small></p><p>I have seen many cases when server-side rendering was proposed as the first step to improve the performance in a SPA. This left off the table ideas like bundle-splitting, which would have likely reduced both FMP and TTI.</p><blockquote><p>[…] <strong>you should avoid SSR if you don’t need it.</strong> Most modern web apps require sophisticated interaction with the UI that has to be driven by non-trivial amounts of JavaScript. If you need to write all of that JS anyway, and you <em>don’t</em> need the first page load benefits that SSR gives you, you’ll be better off just building a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell">static app shell</a> and avoiding the headaches of client-server code reuse, data re-hydration, and dynamic content cache invalidation. — <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/when-should-i-server-side-render-c2a383ff2d0f">When should I Server-Side Render?</a> by <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/@mbleigh">Michael Bleigh</a></p></blockquote><p>Single Page Applications that are not server-side rendered can take great advantage from using Service Workers. In most cases the browser requests some data and injects it in a JS template or component. This means that the browser can cache the JS code and the data independently.</p><p>The site can then follow different strategies. For instance, it can load immediately with stale data, similar to what usually happens with native apps. It can also decide to render a skeleton while the data is fetched. In any case, it makes an approach like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/">PRPL</a>, easy to implement.</p><h3 id="Installable-Website"><a href="#Installable-Website" class="headerlink" title="Installable Website"></a>Installable Website</h3><p>You might want to make your website installable, close to what everyone knows as an “app”. For this you don’t need many to use many capabilities from the web. As long as your site runs on HTTPS you just need a web manifest, an icon and a ServiceWorker. You can find documentation on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/">Google’s Developer site</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Installable_PWAs">MDN</a>.</p><p>Your site doesn’t need to be fully functional offline to make it installable. Take for instance Spotify’s Progressive Web App.</p><div class="videoWrapper">    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EvcjSldzQ1E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">Spotify’s Web Player works as an installable PWA.</small></p><p>As you see, the PWA is installable, yet it doesn’t have support for offline navigation nor playback. When there is no connection, the PWA shows this custom page:</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1541171689/shades-of-pwa/spotify-offline.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1541171689/shades-of-pwa/spotify-offline.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1541171689/shades-of-pwa/spotify-offline.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1541171689/shades-of-pwa/spotify-offline.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1541171689/shades-of-pwa/spotify-offline.png"    alt="Spotify web player shows an offline page when there is no internet connection" /></p><p>Installable PWAs are not limited to mobile. They are already supported on <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/desktop">ChromeOS, Windows and Linux</a>, and pretty soon on Mac too (Chrome 72+).</p><h4 id="More-features-enabled-by-Service-Workers"><a href="#More-features-enabled-by-Service-Workers" class="headerlink" title="More features enabled by Service Workers"></a>More features enabled by Service Workers</h4><p>I have only talked about some use cases for ServiceWorkers and other elements of PWAs, but there are more. Browsers can show <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/push-notifications/">push notifications</a> after the user has enabled it for a certain site, and the push notifications are delivered even when the site is not opened. This makes it ideal for reengage with users without having to wait for them to visit your site again.</p><p>You can also use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync">background sync</a>, ideally for schedule data sending beyond the life of the page. Think of uploading pictures or sending chat messages even after the user leaves the page.</p><h3 id="More-Resources"><a href="#More-Resources" class="headerlink" title="More Resources"></a>More Resources</h3><p>I love reading about real sites that have adopted PWAs and have shared their findings. I particularly like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMbSyngXB4">Addy Osmani’s talk “Production Progressive Web Apps With JavaScript Frameworks”</a>, showcasing some case studies from large web sites that have been integrating these technologies to improve their key metrics.</p><div class="videoWrapper">    <iframe width="1764" height="1080" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCMbSyngXB4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p>They are good examples to demonstrate that you don’t need to re-architecture an existing site to use PWA goodness, and that you can apply some of these concepts and see improvements in perceived performance very quickly.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Optimizing SVGs is great for performance, but can we go beyond? In this post I will show some common issues with inlined and responsive SVGs applied to a real website.</p><p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are ideal to show logos and drawings on the web due to their small size. SVGs also have other useful applications, such as <a href="/svg-placeholders/">placeholders for lazy loaded images</a> and <a href="/drawing-edges-svg/">animations</a>. In a past post I also explained <a href="/optimising-svgs/">how to optimize a SVG</a> with several tools that remove unneeded code and simplify shapes.</p><p>Even if we optimize our SVG assets, we can still make mistakes delivering those to the browser. In this post I am going to explain some issues I found on Spotify’s website, where the same SVG is inlined several times and where a responsive SVG logo could save additional network requests.</p><p><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1537603259/spotify-svg/spotify-svg.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1537603259/spotify-svg/spotify-svg.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1537603259/spotify-svg/spotify-svg.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1537603259/spotify-svg/spotify-svg.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1537603259/spotify-svg/spotify-svg.png"    alt="Spotify SVG logo showing its arcs and points" /></p><span id="more"></span><p>If there is something that all Spotify sites have in common, it’s the Spotify logo. It is usually shown in the header of the page, and also in the footer. In addition the Spotify circle logo might appear somewhere in the middle.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1537603261/spotify-svg/spotify-logos.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1537603261/spotify-svg/spotify-logos.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1537603261/spotify-svg/spotify-logos.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1537603261/spotify-svg/spotify-logos.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1537603261/spotify-svg/spotify-logos.png"    alt="Spotify's home page on www.spotify.com.

They look crisp on every screen, are usually small in bytes, are compressible, stylable through CSS, scriptable through JS… What’s not to like?</p><p>There are still ways to misuse SVGs or not take advantage of its capabilities. In this post I want to explain some improvements that can be applied to the Spotify logo and the way it is served.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Include-it-once"><a href="#Tip-1-Include-it-once" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Include it once"></a>Tip 1: Include it once</h3><p>SVGs can be inserted on web pages in different ways.

further improvements by simplifying paths and rounding the numbers. For example, instead of having a viewbox of 566.93 x 170.04 we could convert it to 567 x 170. Same thing with the position of the points in the paths.</p><p>If you are interested in this topic, I recommend you to read this series of posts by <a href="https://twitter.com/larsenwork">Andreas Larsen</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/larsenwork-andreas-larsen/optimising-svgs-for-web-use-part-1-67e8f2d4035">Optimising SVGs for Web Use - Part 1</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/larsenwork-andreas-larsen/optimising-svgs-for-web-use-part-2-6711cc15df46">Optimising SVGs for Web Use - Part 2</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/larsenwork-andreas-larsen/optimising-svgs-for-web-use-part-2-1-598815d74f9c">Optimising SVGs for Web Use - Part 2½</a></li></ul><p>I spent some time optimizing the Spotify logo following Andreas’ tips. You can read more about it <a href="/optimising-svgs/">on a post I wrote</a>. I managed to get the logo down to 1,859 bytes, or 62,7% reduction from the original image. The resulting image is visually almost identical to the original one.</p><p><a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/pen/BjYaKg">I created a codepen</a> so you can switch between the 2 versions and see it more clearly.</p><iframe id="cp_embed_BjYaKg" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/BjYaKg?height=400&theme-id=0&slug-hash=BjYaKg&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="400" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="100%" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe><h3 id="Tip-3-Responsive-logo"><a href="#Tip-3-Responsive-logo" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Responsive logo!"></a>Tip 3: Responsive logo!</h3><p>SVG is really powerful and people are discovering more use cases every day. We can use SVG to create a responsive logo that changes its contents depending on the size of the image. That’s right, the size of the image, not the viewport. This is similar to what container queries are supposed to do, but we can do it today.</p><p>Take for example the <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/">Spotify for Artists site</a>. On narrow windows it shows the Spotify logo + “for Artists”.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1537603269/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1537603269/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1537603269/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1537603269/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1537603269/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header.jpg"    alt="Spotify logo on Spotify's Artists page" /></p><p>On wider windows it overrides the logo, using a wider one composed of the Spotify logo with “Spotify” + “for Artists”.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1537603271/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header-wide.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1537603271/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header-wide.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1537603271/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header-wide.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1537603271/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header-wide.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1537603271/spotify-svg/spotify-artists-logo-header-wide.jpg"    alt="Spotify logo on Spotify's Artists page (wide version)" /></p><p>Instead of serving 2 different SVGs it’s possible to serve a single one. Then we define the width and height for the logo and let the logo render one of the versions. The advantage is a smaller payload since we can reuse elements like the Spotify circle logo inside the SVG.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/9elements/building-a-responsive-image-e4c6229fa1f6">Building a responsive image</a>” is a post that explains how to achieve this. It shows how to create a responsive logo with 4 different versions, including a rotated/vertical one.

Oh, and <a href="https://twitter.com/kornelski">Kornel Lesiński</a>, the creator of <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a>, a tool I use on a daily basis which has made image optimization a non-brainer for everyone. And lots of very talented speakers who taught me about accessibility, animations, VR, typography…</p><p>The conference was held at a great venue. There was an extreme attention to small details, with lots of well designed posters, video intros, wall stickers, unique badges and even banners that the speakers could take back home.

We have better guides and tools than ever, yet very few companies get to spend time improving performance. You see, <strong>it’s not that we don’t know what causes long blank screens on our sites.</strong></p><blockquote><p>This is not a post explaining why web performance is important.</p></blockquote><p>There are plenty of other resources that do a way better job, with real numbers from real projects. <strong>This is a post about culture and how it determines what is a priority in our companies</strong>. Only by understanding that can we prioritize performance as another feature of our projects.</p><p>If you are reading this you are likely a developer who knows about web and cares about performance. You can represent your team and company if I ask you about where you work and what you do. But <strong>most likely you are not representative for the rest of web developers in your team and company</strong>, unless you are working on your own. And this is fine. The same way you can’t know everything about every discipline.</p><p>In your daily job you have lots of technical areas to care about. You will work hard on implementing features, collaborating with other teams (eg adding scripts for analytics, ads, retargeting, A/B test), setting up CI/CD, ensuring security, and making sure the project is usable and pleasant to the eye. And don’t forget about covering your back with tests.</p><p>You might never have time to look beyond that. Time is finite while your backlog is ever increasing. There needs to be some prioritization.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1527949830/fostering-web-performance-culture/scrum-board.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1527949830/fostering-web-performance-culture/scrum-board.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1527949830/fostering-web-performance-culture/scrum-board.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1527949830/fostering-web-performance-culture/scrum-board.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1527949830/fostering-web-performance-culture/scrum-board.png"    alt="A scrum board showing perfmatters at the bottom" /></p><p><strong>The prioritization should be objective and based on measurable hypothesis.</strong> “We think that by implementing feature X, user retention will grow Y%”. In practice this setup is more difficult. Let’s take a look at those topics we need to care about and think about who proposes them:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Implementing features</strong>: Normally a PO/PM determines what needs to be done next, according to a vision and mission for the team. The feature might come from stakeholders that have a dependency on us (eg adding a third-party script for <a href="https://simonhearne.github.io/weak-links">tracking or A/B testing</a>)</p></li><li><p><strong>Setting up CI/CD</strong>: Although developers could come up with their own build and deployment pipelines, chances are that they are relying on some infrastructure provided by another team (eg an “infra” team)</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: Hopefully there’s a team or individual with deep knowledge about security that help us reviewing system designs, implementations, and informs us about reports or and security patches.</p></li><li><p><strong>UI/UX</strong>: There is usually a designer and/or UX person that sets the look &amp; feel and information architecture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing</strong>: Well, we should write some tests, right?</p></li></ul><p>When someone has the responsibility for a task to be done it will be more likely to be on the board. Most of them can be traced back to a certain role, but others like testing are something developers are supposed to do. Tests are up to the team, and so some parts will be better tested than others.</p><p>We agree that having automated tests is positive. Normally the team decides how well to cover and test the code, and it’s important that all developers in a team know how to write tests. Similar to testing, performance is usually left to the developers to figure out. I find that <strong>it is easier to write tests for a piece of code and knowing the implications of broken code in production, than understanding all the moving boxes that can lead to a bad web performance</strong>.</p><h2 id="6-steps-to-start-a-web-performance-culture"><a href="#6-steps-to-start-a-web-performance-culture" class="headerlink" title="6 steps to start a web performance culture"></a>6 steps to start a web performance culture</h2><p>We have the tools to measure performance, though working on it will be up to the team.

I have an iPhone X as my phone, and my testing device. Also, the speed of my internet connection is humongous and I’m close to data centres located in Stockholm and London. When I finish my job for the day I take the subway, where I have an uninterrupted 4G connection. In fact, Stockholm was the <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2009/12/worlds-first-4glte-network-goes-live-today-in-stockholm">first city in installing 4G back in 2009</a>.</p><p>Except for exceptionally few cases, the users of your product don’t have a similar environment. Not even close.</p><p>**How can we prioritize performance if we don’t perceive performance issues? **It’s like making something accessible without trying to use keyboard navigation, screen readers nor color contrast checkers. There is no way.</p><p>And this is not about to change. Western web developers enjoy using the latest laptops and gadgets. And the chain goes up to pretty much any person responsible for prioritizing tasks and project are your company. Not only that, but in some cases we may prioritize top devices because those are the ones used by the users that are most likely to pay for our product. As <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/">Bruce Lawson</a> put it, we should be building the “world-wide web, not the wealthy western web”.</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/194968584?byline=0&portrait=0" width="684" height="385" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p>Ask yourself if having more users, even though they are <em>less worth</em> economically, is better than having fewer potentially good ones.</p><p>An interesting ramification of not using user’s devices is that <strong>we make false assumptions</strong>. Let’s say we have decided to take a look at the usage stats and deprecate those platforms that have fewer users, or fewer usage (eg less page views per session), in a way to simplify the development and reduce entropy. <strong>There is no point in supporting an old browser that almost nobody uses</strong>. One could argue this is a metric-driven decision.</p><p>Well, not so fast. <strong>What if we are having fewer users or usage on a platform because is just less usable/enjoyable/performant?</strong> This is difficult to prove because developers will say that “the experience” is what they are seeing on their computers using, for example, Google Chrome. Without a bad intention we tend to prioritize the browser we use, and in that prioritization we often decide on trade-offs in favour of the modern environment. “Why are users still using that browser, they should upgrade” I hear you yelling.</p><p>Recently I came across this quote, which I really liked:</p><blockquote><p>“When I was at Google, someone told me a story about a time that “they” completed a big optimization push only to find that measured page load times increased. When they dug into the data, they found that the reason load times had increased was that they got a lot more traffic from Africa after doing the optimizations. The team’s product went from being unusable for people with slow connections to usable, which caused so many users with slow connections to start using the product that load times actually increased.” — <a href="https://danluu.com/web-bloat/">Dan Luu on “Web Bloat”</a></p></blockquote><p>Again, it’s easy to fake performance optimization by leaving out the bad metrics, blocking users who spoil the stats. This is not real performance optimization, <strong>this is just playing with the numbers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Get yourself, and the people working on your project, an old device. Simulate bad network conditions and slow CPUs and make your project resilient. Figure out what devices users own and be careful prioritizing based on what devices users use on your site.</strong></p><h3 id="2-It’s-better-to-learn-the-fundamentals-than-the-library"><a href="#2-It’s-better-to-learn-the-fundamentals-than-the-library" class="headerlink" title="2. It’s better to learn the fundamentals than the library"></a>2. It’s better to learn the fundamentals than the library</h3><p>There are still lots of job descriptions and interview processes that focus on libraries and not the underlying technology. What happens when a browser tries to load a website? What are some reasons why a site can take too long to load? How would you architecture a non-trivial size web project (client, server, databases, caching layer)?</p><p>A developer that is aware of this will make better decisions when choosing what npm libraries to add to the project. They will provide a unique point of view when building features with designers and stakeholders. They will keep an eye on new and old browser APIs and will try to take advantage of the platform, rather than trying to isolate it.</p><p>Your team might need to hire someone familiar with React or Vue. You want them to be productive from day 1, and move the project forward. At the same time you want new hires to stay long at the company, encourage them to question the existing tech decisions and come up with better ones.</p><p>There are 2 constants I’ve seen as a developer over and over again:</p><ol><li><p> <strong>You need to challenge your own company, otherwise a competitor will do.</strong> Promote feedback from individual contributors and give them time to create innovative prototypes and POCs.</p></li><li><p> <strong>The technical decisions you take today have a very short lifespan.</strong> Optimize for deletion, modularity and quick delivery.</p></li></ol><p>If you agree with the above you will benefit from ideas by people that aren’t sold to a specific technology, and can articulate pros and cons for different tech decisions.</p><p>Get involved in the interview process. Propose having time to learn about topics (lunch &amp; learn / brown bags) and hack on ideas that can benefit your projects, which leads us to the next point.</p><h3 id="3-Get-the-time-to-experiment-and-validate"><a href="#3-Get-the-time-to-experiment-and-validate" class="headerlink" title="3.

Get the time to experiment and validate</h3><p>I used to send links to my colleagues about the latest Google I/O talk or medium article talking about some new stuff. I found it useful to keep up to date and thought that I was keeping my mates updated too.</p><p><strong>Often, by blindly sharing content you are making them work harder.</strong> Not only do they have to do their job, but now they also have the peer pressure of reading what you shared. Chances are they better learn by putting it in practice, so now they have the added pressure of having to try out that new library/technique/idea.</p><p>Make them a favor and try to apply the novelty to a project at your company. Instead of thinking “That new browser API sounds cool”, think “<strong>This is how using X will improve our project</strong>”. Sure, it’s more difficult to achieve, but way more valuable. That’s how you can convince your boss.</p><p>There is a lot research on how performance optimization improves key metrics and sites like <a href="https://wpostats.com/">WPO Stats</a> are a good source of case studies.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1527951116/fostering-web-performance-culture/wpo-stats.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1527951116/fostering-web-performance-culture/wpo-stats.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1527951116/fostering-web-performance-culture/wpo-stats.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1527951116/fostering-web-performance-culture/wpo-stats.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1527951116/fostering-web-performance-culture/wpo-stats.jpg"    alt="Lots of case studies where changes in performance led to key metric improvement." /><small class="caption">Lots of case studies where changes in performance led to key metric improvement.</small></p><p>As clear as it can be, sometimes we need more evidence than these case studies to prioritize performance at our companies.</p><p>You might be thinking you will never get the time to work on that POC.

It should be tested, proved that it works, through a prototype or an MVP. Only then it will be built. This also means that everything we build should have had some form of validation. <strong>We should be required to prove why making performant sites drives metrics, but the same applies to any other feature.</strong></p><p>If you had to pick something that you wanted to speed up, choose one that users can perceive. <strong>In order for users to barely see a difference in time duration, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/why-performance-matters-the-perception-of-time/">it has to be changed by a minimum of 20%</a>.</strong> Ideally, <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/highlights-perfmatters-2018-web-performance-conference/">shoot for 30% speed improvements</a>.</p><h3 id="4-Educate-your-Colleagues"><a href="#4-Educate-your-Colleagues" class="headerlink" title="4.

When it comes to performance optimization, it is very easy to introduce a lot of complexity for the sake of small savings.</p><p>A few months ago <a href="https://medium.com/@jmperezperez/lazy-loading-images-on-the-web-to-improve-loading-time-and-saving-bandwidth-ec988b710290">I wrote about image optimization and how to improve perceived performance</a>.

Now, go to your team and tell them you are going to create a backend service that will process images in a queue and store a tiny thumbnail that is served inline when rendering. When will that be run? How long does it take to run? Where do you store? How do you scale it through different servers?</p><p>The most savings are accomplished by not serving images and optimize the ones you serve. That’s the sweet spot. Aim for that.</p><p>Apart from choosing “good enough” solutions that most of your team understand, <strong>think about ways to raise the bar in your team</strong>.

The idea is to collect some metrics like load time or <a href="https://medium.com/@jmperezperez/performanceobserver-and-paint-timing-api-72d3e5b384ea">first-paint</a>, and post them to some service that you can use to visualize and compare them.</p><p>Although you can use something basic like Google Analytics with custom events, I recommend you to use tools tailor-made for this. Check <a href="https://calibreapp.com/">Calibre</a>, <a href="https://speedcurve.com/">SpeedCurve</a> or <a href="https://www.sitespeed.io/">SiteSpeed</a>.</p><video controls style="display:block; margin: 0 auto" width="594" height="516">  <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/video/upload/v1527954529/fostering-web-performance-culture/calibre.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><small class="caption">Calibre’s integration with Slack.

I went through the tool and proposed using it for 3 months, taking a decision on whether to continue using it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formalize it.</strong> I wrote a formal proposal so stakeholders could review. This included sections like “Why use something at all”, “Why use Calibre”, “Advantages”, “Disadvantages” and “Roadmap”.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Componentization has marked a before and after in web development. The main advantages that are usually mentioned is reusability and modularization. Well defined pieces that we can use to build our sites, like bricks of Legos. It turns out this component structure provides a great foundation to improve the performance of our sites.</p><p><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg"    alt="" /></p><p>We are explicit about our dependencies, so we know what code we need to run to run a specific component. Lazy-loading and bundle splitting can have a huge impact on page performance: less code requested, parsed, and executed. And this not only applies to JavaScript, but every type of asset.</p><p>I see many sites that could take advantage of this, and I wanted to show how some basic techniques to load content as needed.</p><span id="more"></span><p>The article will be using Preact/React, yet the ideas can be applied to any other component library.</p><p>We are going to cover several topics:</p><ol><li> <a href="#Compositional-Patterns">Compositional Patterns</a>: Overview of a couple of patterns that we can use to build complex components.</li><li> <a href="#Improving-performance-of-our-sites-by-loading-only-what-is-needed">Improving performance of our sites by loading only what is needed</a>: A practical case where we will apply lazy-loading.</li><li> <a href="#A-small-component-to-detect-when-an-area-is-visible">A small component to detect visibility</a>: A simple component that wraps the logic to notify when an element appears on screen.</li><li> <a href="#More-use-cases">More use cases</a>: We will see that a component to detect visibility can also be useful in other situations.</li><li> <a href="#Polyfilling-IntersectionObserver-on-demand">Polyfilling IntersectionObserver on-demand</a>: How we can include a polyfill only when needed.</li><li> <a href="#Code-Splitting-and-CSS-in-JS">Code Splitting and CSS-in-JS</a>: How CSS-in-JS extends code-splitting and lazy-loading to CSS, SVGs and other resources.</li><li> <a href="#Useful-implementations">Useful implementations</a>: Existing npm libraries that implement the pattern we have gone through.</li></ol><p>Let’s start!</p><h2 id="Compositional-Patterns"><a href="#Compositional-Patterns" class="headerlink" title="Compositional Patterns"></a>Compositional Patterns</h2><p>In a component world components aren’t only used for rendering actual pixels on the screen. They can also wrap functionality that is passed to children components.</p><p>This is usually achieved using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html">High Order Components (HOC)</a>. These components receive another component and add some functionality, like a behavior.</p><p>If you have used redux, the <code>connect</code> function is a HOC that receives your not-connected component. You can find more examples on “<a href="https://medium.com/@franleplant/react-higher-order-components-in-depth-cf9032ee6c3e">React Higher Order Components in depth</a>“ by Fran Guijarro.</p><pre class=" language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx"><span class="token keyword">const</span> MyComponent <span class="token operator">=</span> props <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>    <span class="token entity" title="&#123;">&amp;#123;</span>props<span class="token punctuation">.</span>id<span class="token entity" title="&#125;">&amp;#125;</span> <span class="token operator">-</span> <span class="token entity" title="&#123;">&amp;#123;</span>props<span class="token punctuation">.</span>name<span class="token entity" title="&#125;">&amp;#125;</span>  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token comment" spellcheck="true">// ...</span><span class="token keyword">const</span> ConnectedComponent <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">connect</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>  mapStateToProps<span class="token punctuation">,</span>  mapDispatchToProps<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>MyComponent<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>Function as Child Component (also known as “<a href="https://reactpatterns.com/#render-callback">Render Callback</a>“) is another pattern used in similar scenarios.

After all, it’s the top most component. It is less likely that they see the gallery, map and footer, unless they scroll.</p><p>Most times you would include all the scripts and CSS needed to render all sections as soon as the user visits the page. Until recently it was difficult to define a module’s dependencies, and load what was needed.</p><p>Years ago, pre-ES6, large companies came up with their own solutions to define dependencies and load them as needed. Yahoo built <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=E7p-07kNfXYC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=yahoo+yui+loader&source=bl&ots=UOcpQHdaRp&sig=AGTHNZvPYXWdU9lkj9klzTEa3ys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjn26Wti8PZAhUJDSwKHQOsCbIQ6AEIVDAG#v=onepage&q=yahoo%20yui%20loader&f=false">YUI Loader</a> and Facebook wrote <a href="/facebook-frontend-javascript/">Haste, Bootloader and Primer</a>.</p><p>When you send the user code that is not needed, you waste resources from your end, and from the user’s end. More bandwidth to transfer the data, more CPU to parse and execute them, and more memory to keep around. And those assets will steal the limited resources from other critical assets that need it more urgently.</p><p>What’s the point in requesting resources that the user will not need, like images that the user won’t reach? Or loading a 3rd party component like a Google Map, with all its additional assets needed to render the thing?</p><p>A code coverage report, like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes#coverage">the one Google Chrome provides</a> <strong>won’t help us much</strong>.

We don’t want to apply lazy-loading to everything. Here are some points to take into account.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t lazy load above the fold</strong>. In most cases we want the above-the-fold content to be rendered as soon as possible. Every lazy-loading technique will introduce a delay. The browser has to run the JS that injects the HTML to the document, parse it and start requesting the referenced assets.</li></ul><p><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/fold.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/fold.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/fold.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/fold.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/fold.png"    alt="Don't lazy load above the fold" /></p><p>Where to set the fold? This is tricky, and it will depend on the user’s device, which varies greatly, and your layout.</p><ul><li><strong>Lazy load a bit earlier than when it’s needed</strong>. You want to avoid showing void areas to the user. For this, you can load an asset that is needed when it’s closed enough to the visible area. For instance, a user scrolls down and if the image to load is, let’s say, 100px below the bottom of the viewport, start requesting it.</li></ul><p><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png"    alt="Lazy load a bit earlier than when it's needed" /></p><ul><li><p>**Invisible content in some scenarios**. You need to take into account that lazy-loaded content won't be shown in some situations:</p> - If the lazy-loaded content hasn't been loaded it won't show up when printing the page. - The same can happen when the page is shown in RSS readers that might not execute the Javascript needed to load the content. - When it comes to SEO, you might have issues indexing lazy-loaded content on Google. At the time of writing this article, Googlebot supports IntersectionObserver and it invokes its callback with changes in the viewport above the fold. However, **it won't trigger the callback for content below the fold**. Thus, **that content won't be seen nor indexed by Google**.   If you content is important you can, for instance, render the text and lazy-load components like images and other widgets (eg maps).<p>Here I’m rendering <a href="https://jmperezperez.com/lazy-load/89b6f20e1d79e9fb902242ab84217b12.html">a test page</a> (you can see the source <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/lazy-load/blob/master/text-above-fold.js">here</a>) using Google Webmaster Tools’ “Fetch as Google”.

intersects with the viewport, that is, it’s visible.

The options are set in the constructor, and they are read-only. Thus, adding support for options means that we would need to reinstantiate the IntersectionObserver with new options when they change, adding some extra logic in <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> that we are not going to cover here.</p><p>Now, we can use this component to lazy load two of our components, <code>Gallery</code> and <code>Map</code>:</p><pre class=" language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx"><span class="token keyword">const</span> Page <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token entity" title="&#123;">&amp;#123;</span>  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Header</span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Observer</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token entity" title="&#123;">&amp;#123;</span>isVisible <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Gallery</span> <span class="token attr-name">isVisible</span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span><span class="token entity" title="&#125;">&amp;#125;</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>Observer</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Observer</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token entity" title="&#123;">&amp;#123;</span>isVisible <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Map</span> <span class="token attr-name">isVisible</span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span><span class="token entity" title="&#125;">&amp;#125;</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>Observer</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>    <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Footer</span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token entity" title="&#125;">&amp;#125;</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><p>In the code above I’m just passing the <code>isVisible</code> property to the <code>Gallery</code> and <code>Map</code> components so they handle it.

There are tools like <a href="https://parceljs.org/code_splitting.html">Parcel</a> or <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Webpack</a> that will create a bundle for that imported package, and the logic needed to request the file.</p><h2 id="Code-Splitting-and-CSS-in-JS"><a href="#Code-Splitting-and-CSS-in-JS" class="headerlink" title="Code Splitting and CSS-in-JS"></a>Code Splitting and CSS-in-JS</h2><p>So far we have seen how to use a HOC to detect that an element is within the viewport. We have also seen how to load extra JavaScript when needed.</p><p>Code-splitting is quite common and straightforward to implement at route level, so the browser loads additional bundles as the user navigates across different URLs on the site. Tools like <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/">Next.js</a> have made this straightforward to implement.</p><p>Through the examples on this post we have seen that the same can be achieved within the same route, loading the code for components on-demand. This is very useful if we have components that need a lot of specific code, not only JavaScript.</p><p>A component could link to other resources or even inline them. Think of SVGs or CSS styles.</p><p>There is no point in requesting styles that aren’t going to be applied to any element. Dynamically requesting and injecting CSS causes a FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content). The browser shows the HTML elements with the existing style, and once the additional styles are injected it re-styles the content. With the advent of CSS-in-JS (or JSS) solutions this is no longer a problem. CSS is inlined within the component, and we get true code splitting for our components. <strong>With CSS-in-JS we take code splitting further, loading CSS on demand.</strong></p><h2 id="Useful-implementations"><a href="#Useful-implementations" class="headerlink" title="Useful implementations"></a>Useful implementations</h2><p>In this post I have explained how to implement a basic Observer component.

Las principales ventajas que suelen mencionarse son la reutilización y la modularización. Componentes bien definidos y encapsulados que podemos usar para construir nuestros sitios, como ladrillos de Legos. Una ventaja adicional es que esta estructura de componentes proporciona una base sólida para mejorar la performance de nuestras webs.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1522995807/high-performance_mbjoct.jpg"    alt="" /></p><p>Nuestras dependencias son explícitas, por lo que sabemos qué código necesitamos ejecutar para cargar un componente específico. Lazy-loading y bundle-splitting pueden tener un gran impacto en el rendimiento de la página: requests con menos payload, código parseado y ejecutado. Y esto no solo se aplica a JavaScript, sino a cualquier tipo de asset.</p><p>Creo que muchas webs pueden aprovecharse de estas técnicas, y me gustaría mostrar algunos ejemplos básicos para solicitar recursos cuando sean necesarios.</p><span id="more"></span><p>En este post usaremos Preact/React, pero la idea se puede aplicar a cualquier otra librería basada en componentes.</p><p>Vamos a cubrir varios temas:</p><ol><li> <a href="#Patrones-de-composicion">Patrones de composición</a>: Descripción general de dos patrones que podemos usar para construir componentes complejos.</li><li> <a href="#Mejorando-el-rendimiento-de-nuestras-webs-cargando-solo-lo-necesario">Mejorando el rendimiento de nuestras webs cargando sólo lo necesario</a>: Un caso práctico donde aplicaremos lazy-loading.</li><li> <a href="#Un-pequeno-componente-para-detectar-cuando-una-area-es-visible">Un pequeño componente para detectar visibilidad</a>: Un componente sencillo que contiene la lógica para notificar cuándo aparece un elemento en la pantalla.</li><li> <a href="#Mas-casos-de-uso">Más casos de uso</a>: Veremos que un componente para detectar la visibilidad también puede ser útil en otras situaciones.</li><li> <a href="#Haciendo-polyfill-de-IntersectionObserver-bajo-demanda">Haciendo un polyfill de IntersectionObserver bajo demanda</a>: cómo podemos incluir un polyfill solo cuando sea necesario.</li><li> <a href="#Code-Splitting-y-CSS-in-JS">Code Splitting y CSS-in-JS</a>: cómo CSS-in-JS nos permite extender el code-splitting y lazy-loading a CSS, SVGs y otros recursos.</li><li> <a href="#Implementaciones-utiles">Implementaciones útiles</a>: librerías npm existentes que implementan el patrón que hemos explicado.</li></ol><p>¡Comencemos!</p><h2 id="Patrones-de-composicion"><a href="#Patrones-de-composicion" class="headerlink" title="Patrones de composición"></a>Patrones de composición</h2><p>En el desarrollo web basado en componentes éstos no se usan sólo para renderizar píxeles en la pantalla.

Estos componentes reciben otro componente y aumentan su funcionalidad.</p><p>Si has usado redux, la función <code>connect</code> es un HOC que recibe otro componente.

Hasta hace poco, era difícil definir las dependencias de un módulo y cargar sólo lo que se necesitaba.</p><p>Hace años, antes de ES6, algunas empresas con webs grandes crearon soluciones propias para definir dependencias y cargarlas bajo demanda.

La verdad es que es difícil y depende del dispositivo del usuario y de tu layout.</p><ul><li><strong>Si usas lazy-loading, carga los elementos un poco antes de cuando se necesitan</strong>. Es buena idea evitar mostrar áreas vacías en tu web. Para ello, puedes cargar un elemento cuando esté lo suficientemente cerca del área visible. Por ejemplo, cuando el usuario hace scroll hacia abajo y la imagen a cargar está 100px más abajo, empieza a solicitarla.</li></ul><img      style="max-width:100%"      sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"      loading=lazy      srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 400w,        https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 800w,        https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 1200w,        https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png 1400w"        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1522995652/observer/preloading.png"        alt="Comienza a cargar un poco antes de cuando se necesite" /><ul><li><p>**Contenido invisible en algunos casos**. Debes tener en cuenta que el contenido cargado usando lazy-loading no se mostrará en estas situaciones:</p> - Si el contenido cargado lazy-loading no se ha cargado no se mostrará al intentar imprimir la página. - Lo mismo ocurre cuando la página se muestra en lectores RSS que no ejecuten el JS necesario para cargar el contenido. - Puedes tener problemas con SEO al indexar contenido cargado con lazy-loading en Google. En el momento de escribir este artículo, Googlebot soporta IntersectionObserver e invoca su callback con cambios en el viewport por encima del fold. Sin embargo, **no invoca el callback para contenido por debajo del fold**. Por lo tanto, **ese contenido no será visto ni indexado por Google**.   Si tu contenido es importante puedes renderizar el texto y dejar lazy-loading para componentes como imágenes y otros widgets (por ejemplo mapas).<p>Aquí estoy cargando <a href="https://jmperezperez.com/lazy-load/89b6f20e1d79e9fb902242ab84217b12.html">una página de test</a> (puedes ver el código fuente <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/lazy-load/blob/master/text-above-fold.js">aquí</a>) usando la función “Fetch as Google” de Google Webmaster Tools.

Hay herramientas como <a href="https://parceljs.org/code_splitting.html">Parcel</a> o <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/">Webpack</a> que crearán un bundle para ese paquete importado, así como la lógica para hacer la petición para ese fichero.</p><h2 id="Code-Splitting-y-CSS-in-JS"><a href="#Code-Splitting-y-CSS-in-JS" class="headerlink" title="Code Splitting y CSS-in-JS"></a>Code Splitting y CSS-in-JS</h2><p>Hasta ahora hemos visto cómo usar un HOC para detectar que un elemento está en el viewport. También hemos aprendido cómo cargar JavaScript adicional cuando hace falta.</p><p>Code-splitting es bastante común y fácil de implementar a nivel de ruta. El navegador carga bundles adicionales cuando el usuario va navegando a través de diferentes URLs de la web. Herramientas como <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a> y <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/">Next.js</a> han popularizado code-splitting, integrándolo como parte de dynamic imports.</p><p>A través de varios ejemplos hemos visto que se puede implementar code-splitting dentro de una misma ruta, cargando el código para los componentes bajo demanda. Esto es muy útil si tenemos componentes que necesitan mucho código específico, no sólo JavaScript.</p><p>Un componente puede referenciar otros recursos o incluso contenerlos “inline”. Un ejemplo son SVGs o estilos CSS.</p><p>No tiene sentido solicitar estilos que no se van a aplicar a ningún elemento. Solicitar estilos e inyectarlos dinámicamente causa un FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content). El navegador muestra los elementos HTML con el estilo existente, y una vez que los estilos adicionales son inyectados re-estila el contenido. Con la aparición de soluciones CSS-in-KS (o JSS) esto ya no es un problema. El CSS se incluye inline en el componente, y conseguimos code-splitting verdadero para nuestros componentes. <strong>Con CSS-in-JS llevamos code-splitting más allá, cargando CSS bajo demanda.</strong></p><h2 id="Implementaciones-utiles"><a href="#Implementaciones-utiles" class="headerlink" title="Implementaciones útiles"></a>Implementaciones útiles</h2><p>En este post he explicado cómo implementar un componente Observer básico.

The data is obtained from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/performance"><code>window.performance</code></a>.</p><p>I liked the idea and added a similar snippet that shows the page load time in the footer (you should see it if you scroll to the bottom).

Yet it might not reflect how fast the visible area loads. For instance, a page with lots of images will report a large page load time, since the <code>load</code> event will be triggered when all of them are fetched, even though the above-the-fold content might load way earlier. It is still a good idea, since it forces us to think about lazy-loading the resources when needed.</p><p>I have written before about <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/progressive-image-loading-user-perceived-performance/">user perceived performance</a> and metrics that tell how long it takes to render something on the page.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love hand-drawn graphs and I have always fantasized about applying it tovector images. That’s why I was very happy to find out about<a href="https://roughjs.com/">RoughJS</a>, a library that draws SVG primitives like lines,curves, arcs, polygons, circles, ellipses and paths on a Canvas in a hand-drawnstyle.</p><span id="more"></span><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_RMVGbd" src="//codepen.io/milesmanners/embed/RMVGbd?height=513&theme-id=0&slug-hash=RMVGbd&default-tab=full" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="513" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="684" style="width: 684; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">Applying RoughJS to some icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a></small></p><p>The tool can be very handy for given an informal look to diagrams and charts insome slides or presentations. Do check their <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/rough/wiki/Examples">examplespage</a>, which is very impressive.</p><p>If you have a SVG you can draw the primitives that compose it. In thenext example I’m applying RoughJS to <a href="https://twitter.com/javivelasco">JaviVelasco</a>‘s SF Palace of Fine Arts SVG from<a href="https://zeit.co/day">Zeit’s Day</a>, going through its paths.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom:75%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_QmqdwQ" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/QmqdwQ?height=513&theme-id=0&slug-hash=QmqdwQ&default-tab=full" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="513" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="684" style="width: 684; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">RoughJS applied to a SVG of the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco created byZeit (<a href="https://zeit.co/day">source</a>).</small></p><h4 id="Contour-RoughJS"><a href="#Contour-RoughJS" class="headerlink" title="Contour + RoughJS"></a>Contour + RoughJS</h4><p>In the past I worked on a tool called<a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/contour">Contour</a>  that creates a SVG based on theedges detected on a bitmap image (more info on <a href="/drawing-edges-svg/">this blogpost</a>).</p><p>I wanted to test the combination of Contour and RoughJS, so I took the output of Contour for 3 music album artworks. Contour outputs a SVG with polylines, which doesn’t seem to be supported byRoughJS at the moment, but <a href="https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/pen/GZwgzV">it’s straightforward to convert topaths</a>.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_dmzdeb" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/dmzdeb?height=684&theme-id=0&slug-hash=dmzdeb&default-tab=full" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="684" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="684" style="width: 684; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">RoughJS drawing the above SVGs with some custom options</small></p><p>The effect is very subtle, in part because Contour generates lots of shortlines, but gives the drawing a sketchy style in some traces. Changing the“simplification” and “roughness” <a href="https://github.com/pshihn/rough/wiki">options</a>allows to tweak the result.</p><h4 id="Related-Content"><a href="#Related-Content" class="headerlink" title="Related Content"></a>Related Content</h4><p>If you have read this far you probably like vector images and hand drawing.<a href="https://twitter.com/etportis">Eric Portis</a> shared with me recently a SIGGRAPH2011 paper called “<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~niloy/research/animated_construction_line_drawing/animatedConstructionLineDrawing_sigga11.html">Animated Construction of LineDrawings</a>”,where they infer a plausible stroke order of a static input drawing.</p><div class="videoWrapper">  <iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kme8xbb0sug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe></div><p>The predicted stroke is comparable to the order used by human artists. I thinkit’s really interesting, though I haven’t found any actual implementation of thealgorithm on a website.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>RoughJS is another tool that pushes vector images forward, adding an artistichand-drawn touch to them. I’m looking forward to see how the project evolves andhow it is applied in different use cases.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Choosing a Platform for Blogging</title>
    <link href="https://jmperezperez.com/choosing-platform-blogging"/>

    <updated>2018-12-16T17:51:46.000Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Or why no single platform is the best one.</p><p>As a web developer I consider <strong><a href="https://jmperezperez.com/">my personal website</a> part of my portfolio</strong>. It’s the canonical site where I write about the topics I care about. <a href="https://jmperezperez.com/personal-projects/">It helps me remembering ideas andresources</a>. It also gives me a public presence on Internet beyond <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmperezperez">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jmperezperez">Twitter</a>.</p><p>But It’s not only about the contents. <strong>It’s also about how they are delivered</strong>. My blog is my playground, a space where I can play with browser APIs and put in practice ideas about accessibility and performance.</p><span id="more"></span><p>Several years ago I would use Wordpress to create the content, and wouldn’t careso much about low-level stuff. After all, I was focused on doing .NET and Javaapplications development, and didn’t care much about the web. Nobody read myblog, and scalability or performance were topics that felt far.</p><h3 id="My-Workflow"><a href="#My-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="My Workflow"></a>My Workflow</h3><p>Fast-forward to these days I use a different workflow:</p><ol><li> I write my posts on my personal blog using Markdown. The blog uses<a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> behind the scenes, but this isn’t really important.Most <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static site generators</a> support Markdown thesedays.</li><li> Posts and pages are exported to a static HTML pages. As a bonus, an<a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">AMP</a> version is also generated. I use a <a href="https://github.com/tea3/hexo-generator-amp">hexogenerator</a> that does the heavylifting to create an AMP-compatible version.</li><li> After publishing it, I <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214550207-Import-post">import the post onMedium</a>.Imported stories include a <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en">canonical URL</a> pointing to the original post on myblog. This is important so search engines don’t see it as duplicated content. In other words, this is good for SEO.</li></ol><p>This workflow seems a good compromise to me.</p><p>First, <strong>I want to keep my blog as the canonical place where users will find thecontent</strong>. All publishing platforms I have used are still up and running today,so this is not the issue. I like keeping a link back to my site, where I havefull control of what is delivered, and visitors can know more about me and myprojects.</p><p>Second, <strong>I think AMP can be good for users to identify content that loadsfast</strong> (more on this later). I have been following closely some runts about theAMP format. I’m not a big fan of it, and I would prefer that Google displayedsomehow that a page result is fast enough, without having to be an AMP page.</p><p>Third, I don’t want to miss the network effect of a platform like Medium. Untilrecently, very few visitors would access my site. When Google is your mainsource you need to rank very well. I know enough about SEO to firmly belief<strong>that the best tip is to create useful content.</strong></p><p>Medium posts look beautiful with very little effort. More importantly, <strong>Mediumhas a great network effect</strong>. It makes it easy for people to follow editors (atleast easier than having to subscribe to a RSS feed using some external app orweb) and the content can be showcased through tags. I definitely think thatusing Medium has been key to get a higher exposure.</p><p>Medium also has <a href="https://toppub.xyz/">publications</a> where you can submit your stories. An example is <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-published-in-the-freecodecamp-medium-publication-9b342a22400e">Free Code Camp</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/">Hacker Noon</a>. They can give you feedback to improve your post, and will also do minor editings to make it more compelling.</p><p><img style="margin:0 auto; max-width:300px"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1514724301/medium-stats_dko2nz.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" /><small class="caption">A screenshot of my posts stats a little after I published that SVG post.</span></p><p>I’m not trying to get as many visits as possible for the sake of it. I havereceived lots of interesting comments about my posts on Twitter and Medium. Andthese  posts have opened me the doors to speak at conferences, give interviewsand write guest posts. And I hope my posts have inspired and helped otherdevelopers, the same way their contributions have shaped my knowledge.</p><h4 id="A-Word-about-Performance"><a href="#A-Word-about-Performance" class="headerlink" title="A Word about Performance"></a>A Word about Performance</h4><p>As a web developer who likes to talk about Web Performance Optimization, I can’thelp keeping an eye on the platforms where I’m posting my content.</p><p>Interestingly, I’m not the only one who cares about it. Some users <a href="https://medium.com/@jmperezperez/using-svg-as-placeholders-more-image-loading-techniques-bed1b810ab2c">discussedthe performance of the SVG placeholders post onMedium</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Am I the only person who finds it ironic that a web page about keeping web pagessmall comes with multiple megabytes of Javascript?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It doesn’t need it, folks. It’s a static blog page.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15699302">Hacker News comment on Using SVG as image placeholders</a></p></blockquote><p>In my defense I will say I have little control on Medium.com’s web performance.Also, Medium’s strong point is not performance, as I’ll show in a moment.</p><p>I said earlier that I’m not a big fan of AMP. It is marketed as a project that“enables the creation of websites and ads that are consistently fast, beautifuland high-performing across devices and distribution platforms”.</p><p>Here’s a quick test I recorded using Webpagetest to measure how quickly the pageloaded on the 3 platforms:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1515069420/webpagetest-blog-amp-medium_ktuuib.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" /><small class="caption"><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=180104_QD_5bacc8fc6eddec2cd66f1d5709164188,180104_YD_da5b176b352b4a2ea79154003240653a,180104_G7_9de5273b03f346f1e9e71bb7cd21420e">WebPageTestrun</a>of the same post on 3 different formats/platforms.</span></p><p>As with Medium, AMP is a matter of trade-offs. I really like that the formatenforces good practices, and for most sites it will mean a faster experience.And the fact that users can identify an AMP site with the thunder icon. T<strong>hebiggest win for AMP is in organizations that would prioritize ads and trackingpixels over performance.</strong> In <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/9646">Jeremy Keith</a>’swords:</p><blockquote><p>Now when the boss says “Slap a three megabyte JavaScript library on it so we canshow a carousel”, the developers can only respond with “Google says No.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When the boss says “Slap a ton of third-party trackers on it so we can monetisethose eyeballs”, the developers can only respond with “Google says No.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, if you are a performance geek you can make things faster. Just keepin mind that AMP is not a silver bullet. If you want to read more about AMP Irecommend you to check out <a href="https://css-tricks.com/need-catch-amp-debate/">Chris Coyier’s “Need to Catch Up on the AMPDebate?”</a>.</p><h4 id="Choose-what-is-best-for-you"><a href="#Choose-what-is-best-for-you" class="headerlink" title="Choose what is best for you"></a>Choose what is best for you</h4><p>As with everything in this life, <strong>every platform has its pros and cons</strong>.Hopefully my workflow can help you getting a more informed decision on where youpublish your content.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m passionate about image performance optimisation and making images load fast on the web. One of the most interesting areas of exploration is placeholders: what to show when the image hasn’t loaded yet.</p><p>During the last days I have come across some loading techniques that use SVG, and I would like to describe them in this post.</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg"    alt="Example of a SVG generated using 10 and 100 triangles based on a bitmap image" /></p><p><small class="caption">Generating SVGs from images can be used for placeholders.

When doing lazy-loading of images it’s a good idea to think about what to render as a placeholder, since it can have a big impact in user’s perceived performance. In the past I described several options:</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png"    alt="Several strategies to fill the area of an image before it loads" /></p><p><small class="caption">Several strategies to fill the area of an image before it loads.</small></p><ul><li><strong>Keeping the space empty for the image</strong>: In a world of responsive design, this prevents content from jumping around. Those layout changes are bad from a user’s experience point of view, but also for performance. The browser is forced to do layout re calculations every time it fetches the dimensions of an image, leaving space for it.</li><li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: Imagine that we are displaying a user’s profile image. We might want to display a silhouette in the background. This is shown while the main image is loaded, but also when that request failed or when the user didn’t set any profile picture at all. These images are usually vector-based, and due to their small size are a good candidate to be inlined.</li><li><strong>Solid colour</strong>: Take a colour from the image and use it as the background colour for the placeholder. This can be the dominant colour, the most vibrant… The idea is that it is based on the image you are loading and should help making the transition between no image to image loaded smoother.</li><li><strong>Blurry image</strong>: Also called blur-up technique. You render a tiny version of the image and then transition to the full one. The initial image is tiny both in pixels and kBs. To remove artifacts the image is scaled up and blurred. I have written previously about this on <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">How Medium does progressive image loading</a>, <a href="/webp-placeholder-images">Using WebP to create tiny preview images</a>, and <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">More examples of Progressive Image Loading</a>.</li></ul><p>Turns out there are many other variations and lots of smart people are developing other techniques to create placeholders.</p><p>One of them is having gradients instead of solid colours. The gradients can create a more accurate preview of the final image, with very little overhead (increase in payload).</p><p><img    style="max-width:100%; border: 0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg"    alt="Using gradients as backgrounds. Screenshot from Gradify" /></p><p><small class="caption">Using gradients as backgrounds. Screenshot from Gradify, which is not online anymore. Code <a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify">on GitHub</a>.</small></p><p>Another technique is using SVGs based on the image, which is getting some traction with recent experiments and hacks.</p><h3 id="SVG-based-placeholders"><a href="#SVG-based-placeholders" class="headerlink" title="SVG-based placeholders"></a>SVG-based placeholders</h3><p>We know SVGs are ideal for vector images. In most cases we want to load a bitmap one, so the question is how to vectorise an image. Some options are using edges, shapes and areas.</p><h4 id="Edges"><a href="#Edges" class="headerlink" title="Edges"></a>Edges</h4><p>In <a href="/drawing-edges-svg/">a previous post</a> I explained how to find out the edges of an image and create an animation. My initial goal was to try to draw regions, vectorising the image, but I didn’t know how to do it. I realised that using the edges could also be innovative and I decided to animate them creating a “drawing” effect.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_oogqdp" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/oogqdp?height=600&theme-id=0&slug-hash=oogqdp&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="600" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><h4 id="Shapes"><a href="#Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Shapes"></a>Shapes</h4><p>SVG can also be used to draw areas from the image instead of edges/borders. In a way, we would vectorise a bitmap image to create a placeholder.</p><p>Back in the days I tried to do something similar with triangles. You can see the result in my talks <a href="/cssconfau16/#/45">at CSSConf</a> and <a href="/renderconf17/#/46">Render Conf</a>.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 74%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_BmaWmQ" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/BmaWmQ?height=444&theme-id=0&slug-hash=BmaWmQ&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="444" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><p>The codepen above is a proof of concept of a SVG-based placeholder composed of 245 triangles. The generation of the triangles is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">Delaunay triangulation</a> using <a href="https://github.com/possan/polyserver">Possan’s polyserver</a>. As expected, the more triangles the SVG uses, the bigger the file size.</p><h4 id="Primitive-and-SQIP-a-SVG-based-LQIP-technique"><a href="#Primitive-and-SQIP-a-SVG-based-LQIP-technique" class="headerlink" title="Primitive and SQIP, a SVG-based LQIP technique"></a>Primitive and SQIP, a SVG-based LQIP technique</h4><p>Tobias Baldauf has been working on another Low-Quality Image Placeholder technique using SVGs called <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip">SQIP</a>. Before digging into SQIP itself I will give an overview of <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">Primitive</a>, a library on which SQIP is based.</p><p>Primitive is quite fascinating and I definitely recommend you to check it out. It converts a bitmap image into a SVG composed of overlapping shapes. Its small size makes it suitable for inlining it straight into the page. One less roundtrip, and a meaningful placeholder within the initial HTML payload.</p><p>Primitive generates an image based on shapes like triangles, rectangles and circles (and a few others). In every step it adds a new one. The more steps, the resulting image looks closer to the original one. If your output is SVG it also means the size of the output code will be larger.</p><p>In order to understand how Primitive works, I ran it through a couple of images. I generated SVGs for the pictures using 10 shapes and 100 shapes:</p><div><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg_ifiu2z.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 10 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg_tkr8el.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 100 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367395/pexels-photo-281184-square_tuhvso.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Original picture" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px" /></div><p><small class="caption">Processing <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square.jpg">this picture</a> using Primitive, using <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg">10 shapes</a> and <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg">100 shapes</a>.</small></p><div><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg_aeonon.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 10 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg_t6pwcv.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picturethrough Primitive using 100 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367395/pexels-photo-618463-square_pmbi9x.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Original picture" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px" /></div><p><small class="caption">Processing <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square.jpg">this picture</a> using Primitive, using <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg">10 shapes</a> and <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg">100 shapes</a>.</small></p><p>When using 10 shapes the images we start getting a grasp of the original image.

images generated with 100 shapes are larger, as expected, weighting ~5kB after SVGO (8kB before). They have a great level of detail with a still small payload. The decision of how many triangles to use will depend largely on the type of image (eg contrast, amount of colours, complexity) and level of detail.</p><p>It would be possible to create a script similar to <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/cjpeg-dssim">cpeg-dssim</a> that tweaks the amount of shapes used until a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity">structural similarity</a> threshold is met (or a maximum number of shapes in the worst case).</p><p>These resulting SVGs are great also to use as background images. Being size-constrained and vector-based they are a good candidate for hero images and large backgrounds that otherwise would show artifacts.</p><h4 id="SQIP"><a href="#SQIP" class="headerlink" title="SQIP"></a>SQIP</h4><p>In <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip">Tobias’ own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>SQIP is an attempt to find a balance between these two extremes: it makes use of <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">Primitive</a> to generate a SVG consisting of several simple shapes that approximate the main features visible inside the image, optimizes the SVG using <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a> and adds a Gaussian Blur filter to it. This produces a SVG placeholder which weighs in at only ~800–1000 bytes, looks smooth on all screens and provides an visual cue of image contents to come.</p></blockquote><p>The result is similar to using a tiny placeholder image for the blur-up technique (what <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Medium</a> and <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">other sites</a> do). The difference is that instead of using a bitmap image, eg JPG or WebP, the placeholder is SVG.</p><p>If we run SQIP against the original images we’ll get this:</p><div><img

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Me apasiona la optimización del rendimiento de imágenes y hacer que las imágenes carguen rápido. Una de las áreas de estudio más interesantes es el placeholder: qué mostrar cuando la imagen todavía no se ha cargado.</p><p>Durante los últimos días me he encontrado con algunas técnicas de carga que usan SVG, y me gustaría describirlas en este post.</p><p><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    alt="Ejemplo de un SVG generado utilizando 10 y 100 triángulos basado en una imagen de mapa de bits" /><small class="caption">Los SVGs generados a partir de imágenes pueden ser usados como placeholders. ¡Sigue leyendo!</small></p><span id="more"></span><p>En esta publicación hablaré sobre estos temas:</p><ul><li>Descripción general de los diferentes tipos de placeholders</li><li>Placeholders basados en SVG (contornos, formas y siluetas)</li><li>Automatización del proceso.</li></ul><h3 id="Descripcion-general-de-los-diferentes-tipos-de-placeholders"><a href="#Descripcion-general-de-los-diferentes-tipos-de-placeholders" class="headerlink" title="Descripción general de los diferentes tipos de placeholders"></a>Descripción general de los diferentes tipos de placeholders</h3><p>En el pasado <a href="/lazy-loading-images">he escrito sobre placeholders y lazy-load de imágenes</a>, y también <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szmVNOnkwoU">he dado charlas sobre ello</a>. Cuando se hace lazy-load de imágenes es conveniente pensar en qué renderizar como placeholder, dado que puede tener un gran impacto en el rendimiento percibido por el usuario. Hace un tiempo describí algunas opciones:</p><p><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" /><small class="caption">Diferentes estrategias para rellenar el área de una imagen mientras ésta carga.</small></p><ul><li><strong>Mantener el espacio vacío para las imágenes</strong>: En un mundo de diseño responsive, reservar el área para la imagen evita que el contenido salte. Los cambios de layout son malos desde el punto de vista de la experiencia de usuario, pero también son nefastos en cuanto al rendimiento. El navegador debe recalcular el layout cada vez que obtiene las dimensiones de una imagen, para dejar espacio para la misma.</li><li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: Imagina que estamos mostrando la imagen de perfil de un usuario. Quizás queremos mostrar una silueta como imagen de background. Esta imagen se muestra mientras la imagen principal está cargando, pero también si la petición falla o si el usuario no ha establecido ninguna imagen de perfil. Habitualmente estas imágenes son vectoriales, y dado su pequeño tamaño son excelentes candidatas para ser servidas inline.</li><li><strong>Color sólido</strong>: Podemos tomar un color de la imagen y usarlo como color de fondo en el placeholder. Puede ser el color dominante, el más vibrante… La idea es que está basado o extraído de la imagen que se desea cargar, y el resultado debería ayudar a suavizar la transición entre “no imagen” e “imagen cargada”.</li><li><strong>Imagen desenfocada</strong>: También llamada técnica <em>blur up</em>. Se renderiza una versión muy pequeña de la imagen y se hace la transición a la imagen completa. La imagen inicial es pequeña tanto en píxeles como en kBs. Para eliminar artefactos de compresión la imagen se amplía y se desenfoca. He escrito previamente sobre este tema en <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Cómo Medium hacer carga progresiva de imágenes</a>, <a href="/webp-placeholder-images">Usando WebP para crear previsualizaciones pequeñas</a>, y <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">Más ejemplos de carga progresiva de imágenes</a>.</li></ul><p>Resulta que hay muchas otras variaciones y mucha gente inteligente desarrollando otras técnicas para crear placeholders.</p><p>Una de ellas es generar gradientes o degradados en vez de colores sólidos. Los gradientes pueden crear una previsualización de la imagen final más precisa, con unos pocos bytes extra.</p><p><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto,c_scale,w_1368/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Usando gradientes como fondos. Captura tomada de Gradify"/><small class="caption">Usando gradientes como fondos. Captura de Gradify, que ya no está disponible on-line. El código <a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify">está en GitHub</a>.</small></p><p>Otra técnica consiste en utilizar SVGs basados en la imagen, que está popularizándose gracias a algunos hacks y experimentos recientes.</p><h3 id="Placeholders-basados-en-SVG"><a href="#Placeholders-basados-en-SVG" class="headerlink" title="Placeholders basados en SVG"></a>Placeholders basados en SVG</h3><p>Sabemos que los SVGs son ideales para imágenes vectoriales. En la mayoría de casos queremos cargar una imagen de mapa de bits (JPG, PNG…), así que la cuestión es cómo vectorizar la imagen. Podemos utilizar contornos, formas y áreas.</p><h4 id="Contornos"><a href="#Contornos" class="headerlink" title="Contornos"></a>Contornos</h4><p>En <a href="/drawing-edges-svg/">un post anterior</a> expliqué cómo calcular los contornos de una imagen y animarlos. Mi objetivo inicial era intentar dibujar regiones, vectorizando la imagen, pero no sabía cómo hacerlo. Me di cuenta de que usando los contornos también podía ser innovador y decidí animarlos para crear un efecto de “dibujado”.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_oogqdp" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/oogqdp?height=600&theme-id=0&slug-hash=oogqdp&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="600" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><h4 id="Formas"><a href="#Formas" class="headerlink" title="Formas"></a>Formas</h4><p>También podemos usar SVG para dibujar áreas de la imagen en lugar de contornos o bordes. De alguna manera estaríamos vectorizando una imagen de mapa de bits para crear un placeholder.</p><p>En su día intenté hacer algo similar con triángulos. Puedes ver el resultado en mis charlas <a href="/cssconfau16/#/45">en CSSConf</a> y <a href="/renderconf17/#/46">Render Conf</a>.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 74%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_BmaWmQ" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/BmaWmQ?height=444&theme-id=0&slug-hash=BmaWmQ&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="444" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div><p>Este codepen es una prueba de concepto de un placeholder basado en SVG compuesto por 245 triángulos. La generación de los triángulos utiliza la <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulaci%C3%B3n_de_Delaunay">triangulación de Delaunay</a> a partir del proyecto <a href="https://github.com/possan/polyserver">polyserver de Possan</a>. Como es de esperar, a mayor número de triángulos, mayor es el tamaño del fichero resultante.</p><h4 id="Primitive-y-SQIP-una-tecnica-LQIP-basada-en-SVG"><a href="#Primitive-y-SQIP-una-tecnica-LQIP-basada-en-SVG" class="headerlink" title="Primitive y SQIP, una técnica LQIP basada en SVG"></a>Primitive y SQIP, una técnica LQIP basada en SVG</h4><p>Tobias Baldauf ha estado trabajando en otra técnica LQIP (<em>Low-Quality Image Placeholder</em>) usando SVGs llamada <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip">SQIP</a>. Antes de adentrarnos en SQIP, me gustaría describir <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">Primitive</a>, una librería que SQIP utiliza internamente.</p><p>Primitive es fascinante y recomiendo definitivamente que le eches un ojo. Convierte una imagen de mapa de bits en un SVG compuesto por formas que se solapan. Su pequeño tamaño lo hace ideal para incluirlo de forma inline en la página. Así se consigue reducir una petición, a la vez que se renderiza un placeholder bastante cercano a la imagen final incrustada en el cuerpo del HTML inicial.</p><p>Primitive genera una imagen basada en figuras como triángulos, rectángulos y círculos entre otros. En cada paso añade una figura. A más pasos, la imagen resultante se va pareciendo más a la imagen original. Si el formato de salida elegido es SVG, también significa que el fichero será más grande cuantas más figuras contenga.</p><p>Para comprender cómo funciona Primitive lo ejecuté tomando un par de imágenes de prueba. Generé SVGs a partir de las imágenes usando 10 y 100 triángulos:</p><div><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg_ifiu2z.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Procesando una imagen usando Primitive con 10 triángulos" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg_tkr8el.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Procesando una imagen usando Primitive con 100 triángulos" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367395/pexels-photo-281184-square_tuhvso.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Imagen original" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px" /></div><p><small class="caption">Procesando <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square.jpg">esta imagen</a> con Primitive, usando <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg">10 triángulos</a> y <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg">100 triángulos</a>.</small></p><div><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg_aeonon.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Procesando una imagen usando Primitive con 10 triángulos" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg_t6pwcv.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Procesando una imagen usando Primitive con 100 triángulos" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:228,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367395/pexels-photo-618463-square_pmbi9x.jpg"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Imagen original" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px" /></div><p><small class="caption">Procesando <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square.jpg">esta imagen</a> con Primitive, usando <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg">10 triángulos</a> y <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg">100 triángulos</a>.</small></p><p>Usando 10 triángulos las imágenes empiezan a parecerse a la versión original. Estas imágenes SVG pueden ser adecuadas como placeholders. De hecho el código del SVG de 10 triángulos es muy pequeño, unos 1.030 bytes, que pueden reducirse hasta unos 640 bytes si pasamos la salida por SVGO.</p><pre class=" language-html"><code

imágenes generadas con 100 triángulos son más grandes, en kB, como es de esperar. En esta prueba las imágenes ocupan unos 5kB tras aplicar SVGO (8kB antes). Tienen un gran nivel de detalle en un tamaño comedido. La decisión de cuántos triángulos usar depende mucho del tipo de imagen (por ejemplo contraste, cantidad de colores, complejidad de la forma) y el nivel de detalle deseado.</p><p>Sería posible crear un script similar a <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/cjpeg-dssim">cpeg-dssim</a> que ajusta la cantidad de formas hasta llegar a un umbral de <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity">similaridad estructural</a>, o un máximo número de formas en el peor caso.</p><p>Los SVGs resultantes son una buena opción también como imágenes de fondo. Dado que son vectoriales y tienen un tamaño limitado, son un buen candidato para imágenes <em>hero</em> y fondos de gran tamaño que de otro modo mostrarían artefactos de compresión.</p><h4 id="SQIP"><a href="#SQIP" class="headerlink" title="SQIP"></a>SQIP</h4><p>En <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip">palabras de Tobias</a>:</p><blockquote><p>SQIP es un intento de encontrar un balance entre estos dos extremos: hace uso de <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive">Primitive</a> para generar un SVG consistente en varias formas sencillas que aproximan las principales características visibles dentro de la imagen, optimiza el SVG utilizando <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo">SVGO</a> y le añade un filtro de desenfoque gaussiano. Esto produce un placeholder SVG que pesa sólo ~800–1000 bytes, se ve bien en todas las pantallas y proporciona una pista visual del contenido de la imagen que se va a cargar.</p></blockquote><p>El resultado es similar a utilizar una imagen pequeña como placeholder en la técnica blur-up (lo que <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Medium</a> y <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">otros sitios</a> hacen). La diferencia es que, en lugar de utilizar una imagen bitmap como JPG o WebP, el placeholder usa SVG.</p><p>Si ejecutamos SQIP con las imágenes originales obtenemos esto:</p><div><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:342,f_auto,c_scale,w_670/v1509370309/pexels-photo-281184-square-sqip.svg_zspgb0.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 50vw, 342px" alt="SQIP aplicado a una imagen" style="width:49%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px" /><img    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:342,f_auto,c_scale,w_670/v1509370308/pexels-photo-618463-square-sqip.svg_qjrexh.png"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 50vw, 342px" alt="SQIP aplicado a una imagen" style="width:49%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px" /></div><p><small class="caption">Las imágenes resultantes tras aplicar SQIP sobre <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-sqip.svg">la primera imagen</a> y <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-sqip.svg">la segunda</a>.</small></p><p>El SVG resultante ocupa ~900 bytes.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a past post I explained <a href="/duotone-using-fecolormatrix/">how to use SVG and a <code>feColorMatrix</code> filter</a> to apply a duotone effect to an image. This time I’m going to show how to achieve a similar effect with only CSS.</p><div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:1rem"><img    loading="lazy"    style="max-width:100%; border: 0;position:absolute;top:0;left:0"    sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"    srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:400,f_auto/v1587066714/duotone.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:800,f_auto/v1587066714/duotone.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1200,f_auto/v1587066714/duotone.png 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:1400,f_auto/v1587066714/duotone.png 1400w"    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto:100:684,f_auto/v1587066714/duotone.png"    alt="Duotone effect on image using CSS blend modes" /></div><span id="more"></span><p>Demo &amp; Code: <a href="http://codepen.io/jmperez/pen/wrVxga">https://codepen.io/jmperez/pen/wrVxga</a></p><iframe id="cp_embed_wrVxga" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/wrVxga?height=367&theme-id=0&slug-hash=wrVxga&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="367" allowTransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="100%" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe><p>The code consists of a <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code> that has an image set as a background. Then, we add a <code>::before</code> and an <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements with the colours we want to apply and the right blend modes.</p><p>Previously, my colleague Thodoris described how to achieve this effect <a href="http://blog.72lions.com/blog/2015/7/7/duotone-in-js">in JS using Canvas</a> and <a href="http://blog.72lions.com/blog/2015/7/18/duotone-in-ios">in iOS</a>. I also reproduced it using <a href="/duotone-using-fecolormatrix/">SVG and a <code>feColorMatrix</code> filter</a>.</p><p>This version is based on the technique described by Una Kravets:</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Duotone images are so <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/trendy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#trendy</a> right now 😎<br><br>Had some airport time so I drew out how to get this effect w/one div in CSS 😊 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/devdoodles?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#devdoodles</a> <a href="https://t.co/WENOWlwcUY">pic.twitter.com/WENOWlwcUY</a></p>&mdash; Una Kravets 👩🏻‍💻 (@Una) <a href="https://twitter.com/Una/status/923231326420922368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">25 October 2017</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>which is also what the <a href="http://lukyvj.github.io/colofilter.css/">colofilter.css</a> library is based on to achieve the duotone effect.</p>]]></content>
