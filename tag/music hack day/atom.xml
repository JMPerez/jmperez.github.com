<h2 id="Personal-projects"><a href="#Personal-projects" class="headerlink" title="Personal projects"></a>Personal projects</h2><p>I have several small personal projects around Spotify in which I am working in my free time. I recently attended the Music Hack Day Paris 2014, where I coded <a href="http://jmperezperez.com/hacks/iquiz/">Spotify iQuiz</a>, an iQuiz-like web app that uses your Spotify playlists and to create some questions about albums and tracks you saved. I think the most fun part is the Speech Synthesis API, which provides a very easy to use text-to-voice feature, right on your browser.</p>

<p>For these hack projects I definitely need some framework on which build quickly a project. I always try to avoid it at first, and end up using a template engine (when I’m fed up of generating markup using JS), plus too many DOM manipulations and a bad time fixing small issues. This time I started from <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/grunt-template">this template I built</a>, which was helpful for combining and minimizing all the small JS modules I created, and generate the files that I would deploy.</p>
<p>I’m also starting to take into account tests and code coverage earlier in the development process. I am applying it to the <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js">spotify-web-api-js</a> project using grunt with mocha and blanket. I am running tests and checking the coverage from the console as I save files. I have unsuccessfully tried to generate LCOV that I can report to <a href="https://coveralls.io/">Coveralls</a>, and I think that having the output in the console is good so far.</p>
<h2 id="Paris"><a href="#Paris" class="headerlink" title="Paris"></a>Paris</h2><p>Well, and apart from that I got the change of visiting Paris again after 14 years!

In the end, <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/music-hack-day-stockholm-13/hacks">65 projects</a> were built by 162 participants, using APIs from a variety of music services such as Echonest, Musixmatch, Soundcloud, Radio and Spotify among others.

<p>Overall it was a great experience. This was my first hacking event where people from outside my company participated. My project was Extendify, a Chrome Extension that injects Spotify Play Buttons in pages where it detects info related to a track, album or artist. You can <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/extendify">check it out on Github</a>.</p>
<p>You can find nice pictures of the event on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcb1973/">this set of Flickr</a> and <a href="http://eventifier.co/event/musichackday13">Eventifier</a>.</p>
