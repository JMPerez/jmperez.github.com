    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been working recently on <a href="/sync-subs/">Sync Subs</a>. It is a website that allows you to synchronize a file with subtitles (in SRT format) applying a time offset:
<a href="/sync-subs/"><img src="/assets/images/posts/sync-subs.png" alt="Sync Subs - A Subtitles Synchronizer web app"></a></p>
<p>There are lots of websites doing this by letting a user upload a file and then applying the transformation server-side. But with the HTML5 File API you can do this client-side. Thus, you can read the contents of a file, process it and let the user download a file that has been dynamically generated using Javascript in the browser.</p>

<p>I have also been experiencing with Javascript modules written in an AMD style, unit testing, and integration of external services such as <a href="https://travis-ci.org/JMPerez/sync-subs">Travis</a> (for continuous integration) and <a href="https://coveralls.io/r/JMPerez/sync-subs">Coveralls</a> (for code coverage).</p>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/sync-subs">Github</a> for you to play around with it.</p>
